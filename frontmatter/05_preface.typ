#heading(numbering: none)[PREFACE]

Starting this review the intention in first instance was to review and describe the existing manufacturing possibilities of the group of cadmium selenium red glazes. Although it is by far the only way which offers so many possibilities for the creation of real red colours in the various area of the ceramic field, it is not the only one.

With the idea in mind to be more complete, it became more and more obvious to also include the other existing methods' contribution towards realizing reddish colours in ceramics. Moreover, the section describing the historical aspects also grew, slowly but surely.

With admiration of what has been explored and described by numerous historians and investigators, I have tried to confine myself to the most relevant literature and available studies. Realization of the long ceramic traditions in various human cultures and their culminating points which were reached over several eras dictates the importance of mentioning these facts, albeit in more general terms.

I must admit to exploring some side roads which, in my opinion, are mentioned to complement the overall view of the genesis of some red glazes.

The eight different methods reviewed cover the important existing methods for realizing red coloured glazes. Two of them are by far the most important in respect of their industrial applications. These two are the reddish colours obtained by colour stains of the CrSn group and the CdSe glazes.

The most typical red colour, represented by a wavelength of 614 nm and a colour saturation $sigma$ of about 90, is however only possible to create when making use of the facilities offered by the system of the CdSe glazes and CdSe stains. This group of colours and glazes is well known by names such as signal red, cinnabar, scarlet, madder red, lobster red, carmine red, poppy red and pillar box red.

The importance of the CdSe glazes has increased considerably since the end of the fifties and the early sixties of the last century when improved methods were developed for the retention of the red colour under normal industrial firing conditions. The available literature, including patent literature, is somewhat limited in the area of describing the practical application and manufacture of these glazes. It is therefore hoped that this review will also contribute to this knowledge.

Red colours have something defiant in their character but that was not the only reason for this review. Under certain but different circumstances I think I might have undertaken the same exercise for blue.

With my sincere thanks to all who helped me to realize this publication.
