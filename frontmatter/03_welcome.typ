#v(2cm)

This review is intended as a contribution to the common knowledge of producing so-called 'pillarbox' or 'signal red' glazes. It is commonly known that -- despite the long existing ceramic tradition in various human cultures -- the possibilities for successfully producing bright red glazes on an industrial scale only become apparent after further development and perfection of the systems based on the elements cadmium, sulphur and selenium.

Besides the current method, seven other methods for producing red colours are also reviewed. Some of these have long traditions like the iron and copper reds. Some of the chromium based red glazes can approximate the CdSe glazes in colour value. In general, however, one can state that for all other methods the conditions necessary to create a real red colour tone pose restrictions for applications on a large or industrial scale.
