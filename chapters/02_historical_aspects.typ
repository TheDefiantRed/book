= HISTORICAL ASPECTS OF RED COLOURS <historical-aspects>

#figure(kind: "subtitle", supplement: none, numbering: none)[Including some thoughts about colours other than ceramic red colours.]

Although red is called the colour of activity it is remarkable that the ceramic industry had to wait roughly 8000 years before a more general use and application of the so-called pillar box or signal red colour was possible.

From the early glazed objects as e.g. found after the excavation of ancient Babylon (mainly from 1899 till 1917), till the first half of the 20th century, there were several possible methods of achieving reddish colours. However, none of them gave the typical bright red colours as those based on CdSe.

Most of the bright red colours which were used in the past were all based on organic combinations which made them unsuitable for ceramic applications.

In this field it was already known for a very long time how to prepare a typical clear red colour. Nowadays, only some of these old methods have survived. Most of them are replaced by the synthetic colours.

Although not directly related to ceramics it is interesting to see how some typical red colours were achieved in the past. Most of them are replaced by synthetic colours which offer almost every desirable colour possibility. An exception is of course Mother Nature: she still creates the most beautiful red colours without any human influence.

Several sources mention 'kermes' as the oldest recorded dye; a red colour stain obtained from a particular coccus.#footnote[Methuen. 'Handbook of Colour'; 3rd edition, 1978. Eyre Methuen Ltd, London. ISBN 0 413 33400 7, page 184.] Also the name scarlet has in this respect a long tradition. It is the colour of the dye cochineal, obtained from a special kind of louse. The word is present in many languages. The origin of the word is explained as being derived from the Persian word 'sakirlat' which indicated clothes dyed with this colour. This can also been said from the Arabic 'sagillat'. The word can also been found in the Latin 'scarlatum', the old-French 'escarlate', the old-German 'scharlach' and the English 'scarlet'.

A long existing class of red and purple colours is e.g. the porphyrin group (from the Greek porfyra = purple). In ancient times the old Fenician town Tyros had already a famous purple production around 1200 BC. It is said that a certain kind of 'whelks' were the source for this purple dye. This fact has also given the name to the philosopher Porfyrios (Tyros 232 -- Rome 305). His real name was Malchos but he was called after the purple industry of his native town.

The basic colouring compound is metalloporfyrine. The metal ion can be Fe, Mg, Cu, Zn, Co, etc. These types of compositions are found in numerous, important organic compositions like hemoglobin (Fe containing porphyrin complex), chlorophyll (Mg containing porphyrin complex) and others.

Solutions of porphyrines have, just like those of pyrrole, the property to colour deep red in a reaction with organic solvents and mineral acids.

In medicine the complex zinc-proto-porfyrine (zpp) is also known as a means to check a possible increase of lead in blood. However, if the zpp factor is too high it is not necessarily caused by lead poisoning. There are more factors which can lead to an increased zpp factor.

The porphyrine compounds play an important role in the hemoglobin. It is well known that hemoglobin is important for the transport of oxygen and the removal of carbon dioxide. The active group hematine forms part of the hemoglobin and this plays an important role in the binding and relinquishment of oxygen in the blood.

The carotenoids are another group of yellow, orange till red colours belonging to the group of tetraterpenes. A well known representative of this group is carotene, responsible for the orange colouring of carrots. Other representatives of this group of colours are responsible e.g. for the yellow colour of the dandelion, the orange/red colour of tomatoes and also for the yellow colour of the canary.

Another organic possibility which was used to obtain a warm red colour came from the roots of the 'Rubia Tinctorum'. This plant was first cultivated in Asia (India, Iran, Egypt), followed by the countries around the Mediterranean. From the 16th century, the plant was also cultivated on a rather large scale in France and The Netherlands (mainly the south-west part). The dried and pulverized roots were used for colouring wool and silk.#footnote[Dr. J. M. G.van der Poel. 'De Teelt van Meekrap'. Agronomisch-Historische Bijdragen, deel VI, Wageningen, 1964.] The important component here is alizarine (from the Arab word 'al oesara' = the sap). The chemical compound responsible for the colouring is 1,2-dihydroxyanthraquinone ($"C"_(14)"H"_8"O"_4$). This compound is intrinsically light coloured. When chemically bound with metal oxides (Al, Zn) the real vivid red colours become possible to produce. Similarly, clear red colours could be created (figures 3 and 4).

In 1868 Graebe and Liebermann succeeded in producing alizarine synthetically starting from coal tar. From that time the plant became unimportant and later on the alizarine itself also. One of the applications today of alizarine red is e.g. in the plastic industry but only to a minor extent. The reasons for this are its inferior heat resistance and its poor resistance to ultra violet light and chemicals.

Another way to obtain bright red colours was the so-called 'orseille', a vegetable colour pigment prepared through extraction of various kinds of lichen with ammonia.

The colouring component is orceine ($"C"_(28)"H"_(24)"O"_7"N"_2$). This orceine is the purified extract from the orseille. One of the families of lichen which was important in this respect was the Rocella species. It is said that the name (orceine as well as orseille) stems from Rosela, a rich traders family from Firenze. They were trading with these types of lichen pigments as early as the 14th century.#footnote[Prof. Dr. Hermann Römpp. 'Chemie Lexicon'. Frankische Verlagshandlung, Stuttgart, 1962.] H. Musso#footnote[Prof. Dr. Hermann Römpp. 'Chemie Lexicon'. Frankische Verlagshandlung, Stuutgart, 1962] succeeded in decomposing the orceine in 14 components in a chromatographic way. The main components are $alpha$-amino orceine ($"C"_(21)"H"_(18)"O"_4"N"_2$) and $gamma$-amino orceine ($"C"_(28)"H"_(24)"O"_6"N"_6$). As a colouring agent it is almost completely replaced by synthetic colours. In the food industry it is still used on a small scale.

Litmus is very similar to orceine and is derived from the same kind of lichen.

Similarly the famous Harris Tweed is said to be coloured with a type of lichen. The reddish-brown colour is obtained with a lichen type having the local name 'crottal'. It is collected by the people living on the Hebrides who still prepare the colour in a traditional way.

'Brazil wood' is a further example. For this aim the wood of the family Caesalpinia and Haematoxylum was utilized. Its purified sap served as an ingredient by the preparation of aluminium-, chromium- and zinc paints. However, these paints were not resistant against acids, alkalines, neither were they light-resistant (UV). Today they are completely replaced by synthetic colours.

Besides these and other vegetable sources of red-making colours, there were also some animal-organic pigments in use. One on these was carmine. This was prepared from the female cochenille lice. The lice were dried and after boiling in water the colour was separated in the form of a sediment. The colouring component is mainly carmine acid. To make it more suitable as a pigment it was precipitated on a carrier, in most cases alum.

It will be clear that there are a number of disadvantages with regard to these natural colours. The production methods, the inferior resistance to chemicals and UV light can be highlighted. The situation regarding the production and application of organic colours changed completely by the discovery of aniline. Aniline (from the Arab word anil = indigo plant) is an amine derived from benzene by substitution of a hydrogen atom by an amino group with the formula $"C"_6"H"_5-"NH"_2$.

Aniline was discovered by Otto Unverdorben in 1826. He succeeded in isolating the component from the products obtained by a dry distillation process of indigo. The preparation nowadays is done by reduction of nitrobenzene with the help of iron filings and diluted HCl. Directly after the distillation the aniline is colourless but due to the influence of light a brownish colour appears. At temperatures as low as -6 °C the aniline solidifies. It has a slight but unpleasant smell and it is highly toxic.

Aniline is a weak base with salts which can easily be hydrolyzed. The hydrogen atoms of the $"NH"_2$ group can be replaced by alkali metals. A typical and important reaction of aniline and the other aryl amines is the formation of diazonium salts $"C"_6"H"_5"N"_2"Cl"$ by the influence of $"HNO"_2$. These salts are starting points for hydrazines and for the important azo colours.

Aniline is also the starting point for secondary bases from the type $"C"_6"H"_5-"NH"-"CH"_3$ or $"C"_6"H"_5-"NH"-"C"_6"H"_5$ and of tertiary bases of the type $"C"_6"H"_5-"N"("CH"_3)_2$. These are mixed bases because they are both aliphatic and aromatic. They are produced by influence of alcohols on aniline under pressure in the presence of $"H"_2"SO"_4$. The bases give under influence of $"HNO"_2$ paranitroso combinations $"ON"-"C"_6"H"_5-"N"("CH"_3)_2$. These are the starting points for azine and oxazine colours.

All these organic colours, based on pure chemical reactions, have now replaced the natural colours. There is no need here to point out that the development of these colours could take place thanks to their durability advantages over the natural colours.

This picture of relieving and succeeding methods for red colouring can also be recorded with regard to the methods on creating a deep red colour in ceramics.

It can roughly be stated that the oldest methods made use of red coloured clays ($"Fe"_2"O"_3$). Notably it is not only the use of red coloured clays, but also the development of techniques which created warm and deep red colours and which could only be duplicated after thorough investigations and a lot of trial and error work during the first half of the 20th century.

Iron is the most important natural colorant in clays. Together with some other components like CaO, MgO and $"TiO"_2$ it gives specific colours which are - among other things - dependent on the processing of the raw materials and the firing conditions. The colouring properties of iron compounds were already known and utilized before one could speak of a ceramic use or tradition. Some well known earth colours such as yellow and red ochre, sienna and umber exist in mixtures of iron hydroxide (Goethite), clays and quartz. The iron compounds in sediments are developed by weathering of iron-containing minerals. During the formation of clay materials, the iron is partially built in. The main part however is separated as iron (III) hydroxide which is rather insoluble at an acidity of 6 or 7. In a publication of Fischer#footnote[P. Fisher. Lecture given for the DKG, Bezirksgruppe Nordrhein-Westfalen. November 7th, 1982.] he indicates the following compositions of some well known earth colours:

These types of earth colours were applied in paintings during the late-Paleolithicum. As such they are the oldest type of paints and most probably older than ceramics. The homo sapiens living in the late-Paleolithicum have left us evidence of earth colours as can be seen in the admirable paintings in beautiful red colours like those in the caves of Lascaux, Altamira, Font de Gaume and others. The cave of Altamira e.g. has a 'room' called the 'Sistine chapel of prehistory'#footnote[Geoffrey Bibby. 'The Testimony of the Spade'. J. M. Meulenhoff, 1959.] and the paintings of bulls, horses, deer and bison stem from the Magdalénien ($plus.minus$ 12000 BC).

Although science cannot give an exact time or place were a society started to use clay as building material or for food storing, there are some historical clues that one of the oldest and common ceramic industries existed in the Near East countries. This dated back some 7000 to 8000 years.#footnote[Robert J. Charleston. 'World Ceramics'. Hamlyn Publishers, London, 1977. ISBN 0 600 03949 8.] Even before this time it was already known how to make use of the plastic properties of clay. Many human and animal figures are found at several human civilizations around the world. As one example of the existence of a kind of pottery culture at a completely different place, the so-called band-ceramic culture can be mentioned. Under the leadership of prof. dr. P.J.R. Modderman excavation and a study were made from 1950 till 1966 in Elsloo, a small village in the Dutch province Limburg. In that place an ancient settlement was found. With the active carbon method the settlement could be dated as from 4400 till 4000 BC.#footnote[Prof. Dr. P. J. R. Modderman. Article in 'Algemeen Dagblad' May 28th, 1966.] The ceramic articles which were found were rather simple, except the decoration. The decoration in the form of engraved bands around the upper part of the pots and vases is so typical that it has given the name to the inhabitants of these settlements. The decoration of the oldest pieces was rather simple; the latest vases show a very nice game of lines and points in wavy movements around the vases. These types of settlements of the so-called 'band ceramic people' are found in central Europe along the Danube countries and in western directions following more or less the river Rhine till the south-eastern part of what now is Belgium and The Netherlands.#footnote[Prof. Dr. van Caenegem; Prof. Dr. H. P. H. Jansen. 'De lage landen van prehistorie tot 1500'. Elsevier, 1978. ISBN 90 10 02171 8.]

Another place with an early and famous ceramic tradition and more close to the stream area of Euphrate and Tigris is the delta of the Nile. Archeologists have found evidence suggesting that ceramic knowledge also existed here, including special glazing techniques.

Dr. A. Berendsen#footnote[Dr. A. Berendsen c.s. 'Groot Tegelboek'. Elsevier, 1975. ISBN 90 6113 015 8.] indicates that the oldest known type of wall tiles is found in Egypt and is dated from the 4th millennium BC. In this respect the discoveries made in the complex of Medinet-Haboe near Tell-el-Jahudi in the Nile delta are of a great importance.

Steinbrecht#footnote[Gustav Steinbrecht. 'Die Steingut Fabrikation'. A. Hartlebens Verlag, Wien / Leipzig, 1925.] mentions a discovery of a small statue at the Nile delta in 1875 which represents a hippopotamus. The statue is made from an earthenware type of body and glazed with a green coloured glaze. According to the engraved hieroglyphics, the statue could be dated as from 4000 BC.

Copper oxide was one of the main oxides used for colouring, resulting in the old 'Egyptian blue' colours. The technique of inlaid work was already applied in early times. Famous is a deep blue coloured bracelet of Amenhotep III (abt. 1411-1375 BC). Sir Flinders Petrie has found examples of faience which could be dated from the 18th dynasty (1580-1335 BC). The different parts, as e.g. light blue coloured corn flowers and a yellow coloured background, are made separately and later assembled. Other well known specimens of an Egyptian ceramic tradition are the King-cartouches. Since the reign of Seti I (abt. 1308-1298 BC) this method of making the cartouches appears popular. The engraved parts are filled with glaze giving a beautiful array of dark blue coloured parts and lines and the light blue coloured parts appeared. The cartouche in faience technique of Ramses III, dated abt. 1180 BC is in the British museum in London#footnote[Dr. Anne Berendsen c.s.' Groot Tegelboek'. Elsevier Nederland bv, Amsterdam, 1975. ISBN 90 6113 015 8.] and is a beautiful example of this technique.

One of the explanations for the evolution of ceramic articles like pots, vessels and vases is the ongoing necessity for storing food. Besides evidence of ceramic pieces the fire places or kilns where the articles were fired were also discovered. Vertical kilns, in which the potters' ware did not come into direct contact with the flames, are found in Mesopotamia and also in Iran.#footnote[Stephan Fitz. 'The coloured glazes of the Neo-Babylonian wall-facings'. Cfi/Ber.DKG, 3/82, p.179-185.] These kilns could be dated $plus.minus$ 4000 BC. The products from that time show that one was able, by varying the thickness of one or more pigment containing layers, to obtain polychrome coloured articles. Well known examples are found in the northern part of Mesopotamia. One of the examples of this ancient art of pottery is a plate with a diameter of 12 cm. It is polychrome decorated and originated from the Tell Halaf period, found in Arpachiyah and dated from 4500 -- 4000 BC. It is only one example of the multitude of data which are known today and which show clearly that from the 5th millennium BC the existence of rather high ceramic standards.

An important fact is that in the Middle East area, Assyrian power and culture reached a high degree under several rulers. One of them was King Assurbanipal (668 -- 626 BC). He developed, like other Assyrian rulers, a predilection to fix and collect scientific, religious and literary texts. He also installed the famous Royal Library at Nineveh which consisted of over more than 20,000 clay tablets. These clay tablets are closely written on both sides in cuneiform. Thanks to these 'ceramic papers' and the fact that they are not completely destroyed in this ever turbulent part of the world, we know not only the famous Gilgamesh epos, but also a lot of other valuable information. Most of these clay tablets are now in the British Museum. Another clay tablet which is called the 'Glassmakers Tablet' and found in Tall'Umar (Iraq) is dated from the 17th century BC. It gives the earliest known description and formulae for making copper-lead glazes and moreover their application to earthenware articles. This famous clay tablet is also in the British Museum and is catalogued under the number BM 120960 (figure 7). The tablet measures $3 1/4 times 2 1/16 "in." = 8.25 times 5.24 "cm"$ and is a unique writing in the history of chemistry and more in particular in the history of ceramics as it is the first known description for the preparation of a glaze. The tablet makes mention of a complete prescription for several glazes to be mixed and moreover how to apply them to biscuit fired earthenware.

Other evidence of the same kind for early ceramic cultures is found during the excavation of the Royal Library at Nineveh and dated as from the 7th century BC.

From the translation of the so-called 'Glassmakers Tablet' which are available, namely one of C. J. Gadd and R. Campbell Thomson#footnote[C. J. Gadd; R. Campbell Thomson. 'A Middle-Babylonian Chemical Text'. Journal Iraq, Vol.3, London, 1936.] and another one of A. L. Oppenheim#footnote[A. L. Oppenheim. 'Glass and Glassmaking in ancient Mesopotamia'. Corning Museum of Glass, Corning, New York, 1970.], it is possible to get a view of the then present knowledge of glass- and glaze techniques.

) <fig:glassmakers-tablet>

The text of the tablet is divided into five chapters. The first chapter gives the receipt for 'lead-copper' glaze; the second chapter gives a receipt for 'Akkadian-copper'. Chapter three describes the handling of the clay for the potter ware to be glazed. Chapter four mentions the glazing, while the fifth chapter gives the signature which translation reads as follows:

'Liballit-Marduk, Son of Ussur-an-Marduk, priest of Marduk, a man (native) of Babylon, Month of Tebet, 24th day, year after (which) Gulkishar (became) the king'.

Although Assyriologists had already succeeded to unravel Assyrian cuneiform more than a hundred years ago, one can notice some differences in the mentioned translations. Where Campbell Thomson mentions salpeter, Oppenheims' translation gives anzahhu-glass. Another difference is that Campbell Thomson makes mention of lime, where Oppenheim mentions antimony. Furthermore, a striking difference is that Oppenheim states that the BM 120960 text gives 'a prescription how to produce red-stone coloured glass'. Following Oppenheim, chapter one gives the recipe for Assyrian red-stone glass and chapter two the recipe for Akkadian red-stone glass. R. Campbell Thomson, who has done a lot of work in respect of investigation and translation of Assyrian clay tablets, speaks of green lead-copper glazes in his translation.#footnote[private correspondence between author and Prof. K. R. Veenhof, Rijksuniversiteit Leiden, Assyriologisch Instituut, 1984.]

Only the fact that the tablet BM 120960 gives the oldest known ceramic recipe makes it very remarkable, but if translations mention 'red-stone coloured glass' it is of course worthwhile to see if this is the very first recipe for a red glass or glaze ever. Therefore, some practical work has been done following the translations mentioned and further explanations as given by prof. Veenhof from the Assyriologic Institute of the State University of Leiden.

The BM 120960 glazes consist for the main part of a basic material, called zukû-glass. It is generally supposed that the level of glass and glass manufacturing was already that high that a further description of this basic glass could be omitted.

Another explanation is also given, saying that the scribe did not speak the true mind. A reason for the supposition that the zukû-glass had most probably a simple composition is found in its philological connection with 'zakû' which means 'clear'. Investigations to the compositions of early Babylonian glazes#footnote[Robert H. Brill. 'Glass and Glassmaking in ancient Mesopotamia' 'The chemical interpretation of the text'. Corning Museum of Glass, Corning, New York, 1970.] has shown that for copper coloured transparent glazes a simple alkaline silicate glass was used as basic material. As main alkaline component, sodium has been determined via emission spectral analyses.

From the history of glass#footnote[Gustav Weiss. 'Antiek Glas'. Elsevier, Holland, 1980, ISBN 90 10 02910 7.] it is also known that the first type of glass as applied in Egypt as well as in Mesopotamia had the same compositions, namely the three basic components natural soda (called nitrum by Pliny), calcium containing sand and the ash of the marsh plant salicornia. It is also generally assumed that a deliberate separation between glass and glazes for ceramic use appeared from the middle of the 16th century BC. Therefore, it can be supposed that the basic components for glass as well as for glazes were generally the same.

Hecht#footnote[Hecht. Keramische Rundschau, 1913, p.525.] has determined the influence of glaze components in relation with the colour development in this type of glazes. From this survey it is shown that pure alkaline silicate glazes with 3 mol $"SiO"_2$ developed the most beautiful blue colours. Besides the glaze itself, the body used is also important. This influence of the body composition with regard to this type of glazes, often called Egyptian or Persian blue, is described by M.M. French.#footnote[M. M. French. Journal of the American Ceramic Society, 1923, p.405.] From these investigations the conclusion was drawn that quartz-rich and calcium-poor bodies were favourable for the development of the blue colour. W. Henze#footnote[W. Henze. Keramische Rundschau, 1928, p.821.] reports also that just alkaline silicate compositions render good results. Also an alkaline-lead-silicate with 18% PbO develops a good 'well-melted Turkish blue'.

From the before mentioned examinations, it is plausible to suppose that the base glass from the Glassmakers Tablet, mentioned as zukû-glass, could have consisted of an alkaline silicate, e.g. in the mole ratio alkaline : $"SiO"_2$ = 1 : 3 and where the alkaline is singly represented by sodium. Presuming this, the glaze composition should have been read as mentioned in @fig:glaze-composition:

The colour of the glazes of @tab:oxide-comparison do not show much difference in appearance and colour development when applied to several bodies. A greater difference than that between the glazes is noticed for the same glaze applied on different bodies as shown by @fig:blue-glaze. For these three articles the same glaze was used, namely the chapter one glaze according to Campbell Thomson. The most beautiful blue colour, reminiscent of the colour of Lapis Lazuli, was achieved using a body with a composition as mentioned in @tab:body-composition:

Although series of trials were also performed in a gas-heated kiln (natural gas) under reducing conditions, it was not possible to obtain (copper) reduced glazes with a reddish colour. Only the blue colour as well known from the ancient times showed up. Based on these facts it may be supposed that the glaze as prescribed on the BM 120960 tablet may have looked like the glaze on @fig:blue-glaze. The BM 120960 Glassmakers Tablet, some 3700 years old, may therefore be considered as one of the first written ceramic recipes (although not a red glaze) and the start of publishing and collecting of ceramic data.
