#figure(kind: "subtitle", supplement: none, numbering: none)[Red shades through calcination.]

A completely different way to obtain reddish colours in ceramics is making use of calcined stains e.g. of the chromium tin calcium based type. Besides this rather big family of stains there are also other possibilities to obtain lighter, more rose colour tones like MnAl stains and CrAl stains. Lilac colour stains are normally based on Sn and Cr with a small amount of cobalt to turn the lilac more into the bluish shade. The bigger family of CrSnCa stains has different members but most of them have a maroon, crimson, wine-red or cherry-red like appearance with light and darker members and with reddish or more blue-reddish family members. The final colour depends e.g. on the amount of chromium in the composition, which other components are present, on the processing of the stain but also on the composition of the glaze in which the stain is applied.

Making colourstains by a calcination process (a solid state reaction) is a standard process in ceramics and described in many ceramic books, publications and patents. Through this process it is possible to obtain more temperature stable products also for the highest firing temperatures as applied in ceramics. An important contribution for the development of colours in general and in particular for the family of CrSn pinks was made by Alexandre Brongniart who was leading the still famous Sèvres porcelain factory near Paris. Many new colours were developed under his leadership (1800 -- 1847). Something similar happened in England where new developments were made by Josiah Wedgwood in the 2#super[nd] half of the 18#super[th] century and by his successors. In Germany, they had a famous development centre for porcelain and for colours in Meissen as from the mid 18#super[th] century. It is still amazing to see how these people were able to make the most beautiful colours under the conditions and with the limited possibilities of that time. Now, with all our know-how, quality control programmes and extensive possibilities for making analyses it is in many cases not possible to compete with the masters of ceramic painters and paint manufacturers of that time. For a couple of hundred years, these countries, Germany, France and England have been very important for the various colour developments in ceramics later on followed by e.g. USA with the development of ZrSi based colour stains. Nowadays, there is another threat for the handful of ceramic colour manufacturers left in the Western European world as economical reasons seems to dictate that production of stains is cheaper to do in countries as China. The high demand for ceramic stains in China's home market itself is a main reason that production volumes are increasing year by year and the Chinese made stains are therefore also becoming more and more an important factor as export product, especially for the high volume stains. Prices of the Chinese made stains are in general under the price level of European made stains.

For calcination of a given stain one makes a choice for the most suitable raw materials. Purity and fineness are some of the parameters which are important in this respect#footnote[Dennis Green. 'Composition & Properties of Stains'. Lecture given for the Swedish Ceramic Society, Vedbæk, Denmark, 1981.]. The raw materials are weight into the right proportion for that particular stain followed by mixing. This mixed raw material batch of a given colour stain is than put into refractory saggers followed by a firing process which is typical for that particular stain. After firing the colour stain is milled to the right fineness, if necessary washed, dried, sieved and packed. This is only a general way to produce a standard basic stain. As every new production firing of a new batch may cause some small deviations from standard, the final colour stain is in most cases build up by a high percentage of the basic stain and some materials which give the possibility to correct the small deviations from batch to batch production of the basic stain. In this way, the final colour as supplied to the customers is always brought up and corrected to the standard colour values. Making colourstains is a rather specialized job and very much based on empirical know-how and the above mentioned way is only a general way for manufacturing. Many stains have their special parameters, production process, their special mineralisers to be added, etc. Much of this know-how stays within the manufacturing companies and the specialists involved. Compared to roughly some 50 years ago and given the scaling up and concentrating of volumes at only some limited locations resulting in less production types, the number of experienced people for the manufacturing of colourstains has decreased over time. One can state that the major producers of ceramic stains concentrate on high volume -- high profitable products and they avoid making small volume stains which in a way is a reduction of the total available ceramic colour pallet. Compared to roughly some 50 to 60 years ago some very interesting ceramic pigments are not available anymore as economical reasons, health issues (hexa valent chromium), relocation and concentration of production sites have stopped production of those (smaller volume) stains. One of the examples meant here is e.g. the so-called Manganese-Rose colour stain.

  One of the production processes was as follows#footnote[Anon. Sprechsaal für Keramik-Glas-Email, Heft 6, 1962.]:

  #narrow[
    - 3 kg of manganese nitrate was dissolved in water and mixed with 0.9 kg in water dissolved ammonium phosphate
    - the precipitate was dissolved in 1 ltr nitric acid and mixed with 1 kg aluminium hydroxide
    - this mass was dried and calcined at 1140 °C -- 1160 °C.
    - after the calcination the stain was milled, washed and again calcined at 1280 °C.
  ]
]

The resulting rose pink stain was, after bringing to the right fineness of course, used as under glaze colour, as colourstain for glazes and as body stain. Given the very special way of preparation and health aspects of today it is no wonder that these special stains are no longer produced. MnAl colour stains are still available on the market but made according to a complete dry process.

  Another example is the production of Aluminium Rose, a CrAl stain:

  #narrow[
    - 48 kg of aluminium hydroxide and 45 kg of zinc oxide was mixed.
    - added to this mix was 6 kg potassium dichromate dissolved in water and well mixed together
    - this mixture was than dried and calcined at 1300 °C -- 1400 °C.
    - after calcination the product was milled and washed and then dried.

Also this type of flamingo rose pink colour stain is not produced in this way anymore.

#recipe[
  A very nice flamingo rose pink has been made as follows:

  #figure(
    table(
      columns: (auto, auto),
      stroke: none,
      align: (left, right),
      [tin oxide], [41.16 %],

      [lead oxide], [8.65 %],
      [potassium dichromate], [0.23 %]
    )
  )
]

Mixing and calcining at 1250 °C followed by wet milling and washing, drying and sieving. The result is a nice and clear flamingo rose. Also this stain is not produced anymore for economical and health reasons.

The possibilities for the still widely used wine-red CrSn stains which are worthwhile to mention here are based on the calcination of calcium carbonate, tin oxide, quartz and (green) chromium oxide.

In former days one used to make first a calcium stannate out of calcium carbonate and tin oxide in the ratio 40 : 60. This mixture was wet-milled and calcined at 1150 °C. This calcination product was than wet-milled together with quartz, tin oxide and a chromate, dried and calcined at 1280 °C. This calcined product was wet milled to the right fineness, washed till all soluble chromate salts were removed and then dried.

#recipe[
  An example is the following receipt:

  #figure(
    table(
      columns: (auto, auto),
      stroke: none,
      align: (left, right),
      [calcium carbonate], [23.34 %],
      [tin oxide], [15.56 %],
      table.hline(stroke: 0.5pt),
      [quartz], [38.89 %],
      [tin oxide], [19.40 %],
      [lead chromate], [2.80 %],
      table.hline(stroke: 0.5pt),
      [], [100.00 %]
    )
  )
]

#recipe[
  Also following cherry-red lead containing pink was produced in the past by dry mixing the raw materials, calcining, washing and drying:

  #figure(
    table(
      columns: (auto, auto),
      stroke: none,
      align: (left, right),
      [calcium carbonate], [25.70 %],
      [quartz], [22.48 %],
      [tin oxide], [42.60 %],
      [potassium dichromate], [0.72 %],
      [red lead oxide], [8.50 %],
      table.hline(stroke: 0.5pt),
      [], [100.00 %]
    )
  )
]

Such formulations, having a small percentage of lead (introduced e.g. as lead chromate $"PbCrO"_4$, lead carbonate $"PbCO"_3$ or as red lead oxide) show normally a somewhat more bright and clear (wine) red colour compared to lead free compositions.

As the toxicity of lead compounds and also the lead release following DIN EN 1388 became more and more important, the ceramic industry uses now unleaded stains by preference. In this respect one has also looked for replacements of the lead addition while keeping the good properties caused by the lead addition. An example for such a development is given in US patent 4358321 published in 1982#footnote[US patent 4358321 'Lead-free ceramic pink coloring material consisting of Chromium-tin-calcium-silicon-alkali metal oxide plus bismuth and/or phosphorus oxide and process', Degussa, published 1982.]. The invention describes the application of bismuth and / or phosphate compounds instead of lead compounds resulting in an intense red colour.

  Compositions mentioned are:

      table.hline(stroke: 0.5pt),
      [], [100.00 %], [100.00 %]
    )
  )
]

Following the patent, the materials were wet-mixed and finely ground, the potassium and the bismuth compounds added, mixed and calcined at 1340 °C for 1 hour, wet-ground and washed and then dried.

Today, only the dry process is utilized by dry mixing calcium carbonate, tin oxide, quartz and chromium oxide. For a better dispersion of the chromium oxide, a pre-mix is often made of chromium oxide and quartz with an intensive mixer. The dry mixed batch is than calcined and the pigment is than dry milled to the right fineness. Special materials acting as a catalyst can be added to achieve darker colours.

Lilac colour stains are composed out of tin oxide and a chromium compound, in most cases potassium dichromate $"K"_2"Cr"_2"O"_7$ now replaced by chromium oxide. Materials as cerium oxide, boric acid and lithium carbonate are added following the development of that particular stain.

#recipe[
  Some examples are:

  #figure(
    table(
      columns: (auto, auto, auto),
      stroke: none,
      align: (left, right, right),
      table.header([], [*Dark red lilac*], [*Bluish lilac*]),
      [tin oxide], [91.45 %], [75.35 %],
      [potassium dichromate], [3.45 %], [0.65 %],
      [cerium oxide], [3.75 %], [---],
      [lithium carbonate], [1.35 %], [---],
      [boric acid], [---], [22.35 %],

      [], [], [],
      [calcination temperature:], [1290 °C], [1210 °C]
    )
  )
]


After calcination the stains must be wet-milled to the right fineness, washed and dried. The cobalt oxide is added to turn the lilac colour into a more bluish colour tone (lavender).

With all these examples, however, it is possible to create beautiful wine red, crimson, maroon or cherry-red colours but no clear red colours as possible with CdSe stains or glazes. People with some experience in colour ceramics know that the composition of the glaze is also important for the proper development of CrSn colour shades. Small additions of tin oxide in the glaze formulae help to stabilize the colour. Magnesium must be out of the compositions. No reductions must take place during the glostfiring otherwise the famous white spots will appear in the coloured glaze.

#recipe[
  A typical lead containing glaze which shows a good development for CrSn stains is based on following frit:

      columns: (auto, auto, 2em, auto, auto, 2em, auto, auto),

      [$"PbO"$], [0.539], [], [], [], [], [], [],
    )
  )
]

#recipe[
  The milling formula for the glaze is 90 parts of the frit together with 10 parts of kaolin. This glaze has a maturing firing range of 1020 °C till 1100 °C and shows normally no lead release after standard DIN EN 1388-1 / -2. Despite this, many of this type of glazes have been replaced by unleaded glazes like glazes based on strontium containing frits#footnote[L.W. Baaij. 'Study on Leadfree Strontium containing Glazes', June 1980.] like e.g.:

  #figure(
    table(
      columns: (auto, auto, 2em, auto, auto, 2em, auto, auto),

      [$"BaO"$], [0.107], [], [], [], [], [], [],

  )
]

Milling formula of the glaze is 90 parts of frit together with 10 parts of kaolin. Glazes as these are nowadays widely used as unleaded transparent glazes, also as base glaze for CrSn wine red glazes.

As mentioned, the calcination process gives some different possibilities to obtain reddish colours. However, also in this case none of them can compete or even come close to the clear and bright red colour having a dominate wavelength of about 614 nm. @photo:crsn-vase shows an example of a CrSn coloured ceramic vase.
