Gold is often called the oldest known metal which was and still is used to express a particular richness and also as a standard of value. Specimens are found which could be dated from ancient human civilizations. The occurrence of the metal in pure form and the easy way of manufacture made it possible that it became one of the oldest known and applied metals.

In the 2#super[nd] millennium BC gold started to compete with copper and silver as a standard of value. The first coins from gold and gold-alloys are known from the seventh century BC but remain rare. This scarceness applied specifically to the European countries (Roman Imperium) as there were no gold mines in the European area. The oldest known golden Roman coin, called Aureus, was first made around 217 BC and bears the portrait of the God Janus. This belated use was in contrast with the more eastern area where the use of gold had already a longer existing tradition as metal as such but also in glass.

Gold is another possibility to create red colours when brought into molten glasses. Its application in conjunction with glass is old just as well. The specific application of gold for the preparation of ruby-red glass has also a long existing history. Clay tablets from the time of Assurbanipal (668 -- 626 BC) give already descriptions for the use of gold for the preparation of gold-ruby glass#footnote[Gmelin; Handbuch der Anorganische Chemie, 1954.]. The transliterations of R. Campbell Thomson have in that respect very much contributed to give a better picture of the existing developments at that time.

A famous example of gold-ruby glass and at the same time evidence of the high level of the art of glass manufacturing during the Roman civilization, is the so-called Lycurgus bowl. It is dated as from AD 300 and shows the legendary king Lycurgus from Thracia who is completely and fatally entangled by vine-tendrils. A general explanation for this representation is that Dionysus had turned the nymph Ambrosia into a vine-tendril after she was assaulted by Lycurgus. It is peculiar that the colour of the bowl is changing from olive-green to deep ruby-red, dependent of the amount of light which is fallen onto it (@photo:lycurgus-bowl). Analyses of a shiver showed that the glass contains gold in a quantity of 3 till 5 #sym.permille. This game of colours, changing with the amount of light, did presume that it was a magic bowl which could change water into wine. Now, almost 2000 years later, the Lycurgus bowl is the subject of studies about nanotechnology.

After a peak in glass manufacturing high standards were reached e.g. in Egypt, Mesopotamia and in Syria (from where the invention of the glass-workers blow-pipe is originated, 1#super[st] century BC), there followed a period of decline of roughly 1000 years. Glass manufacturing experienced a certain revival starting roughly in the 10#super[th] century. The powerful position of the church, particularly some monasteries, has without doubt contributed with regard to these developments.

The monasteries, especially some Benedictine ones, could be seen as the defenders of the antique heritage and the guards of the transmitted literature, including those about glass manufacturing. In this respect the books in question from the bishop of Sevilla (7#super[th] century) and the bishop of Mainz (Hrabanus Maurus 'De universo', abt. 845) are dated back to Pliny, one of the main 'technical-encyclopaedists' of the ancient world.

The 'Codex Luccencis' (abt. 800) was based on Byzantine experiences. Another well known compilation of recipes from the 10#super[th] century was mainly based on this codex and is known as 'Mappae Clavicula'.

The recipe-collections of Heraclius, based on these two books, consist of three books. The first two books are dated as from the 10#super[th] century while the third book is dated from the 12#super[th]-13#super[th] century.

One of the more important books in many respects is the book of the Presbyterian priest Theophilus and is called: 'Schedula diversarum artium' and is dated from the 10#super[th] century. In this book the priest describes the than existing methods for all kinds of crafts, including e.g. how to produce leaded windows.

With the start of the Renaissance there appeared several compilations describing again the gold ruby colours of which the 'Secreti per colori' stems from the beginning of the 15#super[th] century. It mentions the following recipe:

#narrow[
  #text(style: "italic")[
    'Take 3 parts of the white material (is lead-crystal glass), 1 part of Goldchalk, 1 part of Brasilash and 3 parts of fine rock salt. These ingredients must be mixed properly in the described ratio and put into a kiln. After four or six hours one must take it out and one shall have red coloured glass'.
  ]
]

The Goldchalk was prepared through a solution of gold in aqua regia.

Another important book was published in 1612 and was written by the Florentine priest Antonio Neri and called 'L'arte vetraria'. The book of Neri gives more or less a status about the situation of the art of glass manufacturing in the Renaissance. Neri mentions also raw materials such like lime and also lead containing materials. As commonly accepted, he was ahead of his time as with these recipes he already indicated the invention later on of the Bohemian lime-glass and the English lead-glass. His compilation was translated into the English language by the doctor Christopher Merret in 1662. In 1674 Ravenscroft required his patent for the lead crystal glass. The publication of Neri covered most of the experiences and recipes known at that moment. His book was published in several Italian editions, an English-one in 1662, two Latin-ones in 1668 and 1686 resp., while Kunckel made a German translation in 1679.

An important development in respect of gold-based ruby red colours was made through the Purple of Cassius. Andreas Cassius graduated in 1632 in London and lived later on as a doctor in Hamburg. His son was the first who published the discoveries of his father ('De Auro', Hamburg, 1685).

According to this publication the preparation was the following:

#narrow[
  #text(style: "italic")[
    'English tin, the purer the better, must be solved in aqua regia until a yellowish or red wine-like solution appears. This solution must be kept for some days in order to give the gases the possibility to escape. Next to this one must prepare a solution of gold in aqua regia "in the normal way". After this one must take a large glassy container with a wide opening and put water into it. One must add somewhat of the tin solution, directly followed by an addition of a same quantity of the gold solution. One shall than remark a gold precipitation which will, under influence of the air, turn into a beautiful purple coloured powder'.
  ]
]

This invention is still the basis for the gold-ruby decoration colours. The variation in this type of colour is from soft clear rose till dark plum pink but all have in common that they are based on gold colours made through the Purple of Cassius concept. More details regarding these onglaze and inglaze decoration colours follow later.

From great influence on the further development were the investigations of J. Kunckel. Kunckel, a German chemist, was not a compiler but he investigated the existing theories of his time. He worked as a chemist and as a pharmacist for the German elector Johann Georg II. Friedrich Wilhelm von Brandenburg leased him the 'Christallinen-Glashütte zu Drewitz', a glass factory in Berlin. At this factory he investigated the recipes as given by Neri. Among these recipes are those for the preparation of gold-ruby red glass. Neither Kunckel, Neri nor Ravenscroft were inventor of this red ruby glass. However, the publications of Kunckel were very important in respect of sieving the then existing information. His work at the Berlin glass manufacturing became of great importance for the further development of ruby red glass, above all that he distinguished the property of the final colour development after reheating of the, in first instance, colourless glass.

During the 18#super[th] century however the ruby red glass and the making of it became less popular. The demand disappeared and with that the knowledge and the experience how to produce it. In 1834 it was necessary to hold a contest 'how to prepare ruby red glass in the most economical way'. This was done by "Der Verein Zur Förderung des Gewerbefleisses in Preussen". From the result of this contest it became clear that it was not an absolute precondition to start from Purple of Cassius, but that metallic gold or any gold solution could do the job.

From the above it may be clear that gold was and still is used to prepare gold ruby red glass. For red glazes gold is not a way for manufacturing but besides the typical nice and bright ruby red gold colour in (crystal) glass there is also a gold application for red colours in ceramics. The application meant here in particular is the one of decoration colours e.g. for porcelain. For a traditional onglaze decoration firing for porcelain one applied since long time abt. 780 °C to 820 °C in a cycle of several hours (traditional cycle). After the invention of the Purple of Cassius, one succeeded in making onglaze decoration colours based on gold, creating the typical red colours. This happened especially after the invention of how to make porcelain (Böttger). By varying the amount of the Purple of Cassius and the addition of other components one succeeded in making a range of gold colours ranging from light rose till dark plum red. Until today, some well known manufacturers of decoration colours like Johnson Matthey, Ferro and also manufacturers of Japan, Taiwan and China are offering these gold colours which are applied in the manufacturing of decals or by direct application. The manufacturing principle is still the same although the processing differs between the manufacturers.

Gold colours are manufactured in light pinks (rose shades), mid-colours (fuchsia shades) till dark red (plum) colours. The light colours have a gold-base part of roughly 2 till 4 parts, the mid-colours between 7 till 10 parts and the dark red colours even up to 20 parts. A gold base exists normally of a gold component (e.g. gold chloride), stannous chloride, stannic chloride, potassium aluminium compound and an ammonium compound. Besides the gold base the compositions of the final colours exists also of suitable fluxes, in most cases two to achieve a good and wide firing range and to obtain the necessary chemical resistance.

#recipe[
  Kenneth Shaw#footnote[Kenneth Shaw. 'Ceramic Colours and Pottery Decoration'. McLaren & Sons Ltd, London, 1962] mentions the following flux composition for use with gold colours:

  #align(center, table(
    columns: 2,
    stroke: none,
    align: (left, right),
    [$"Na"_2"O"$], [10.29 %],
    [$"K"_2"O"$],  [3.64 %],
    [$"PbO"$],     [20.54 %],
    [$"B"_2"O"_3$], [23.28 %],
    [$"SiO"_2$],     [42.25 %],
    table.hline(stroke: 0.5pt),
    [], [100.00 %]
  ))
]

#recipe[
  Other suitable fluxes can be compositions like:

  #align(center, table(
    columns: 5,
    stroke: none,
    align: (left, right, center, left, right),
    [$"Na"_2"O"$], [14.02 %], [and/or], [$"Li"_2"O"$], [1.35 %],
    [$"PbO"$], [33.47 %], [], [$"Na"_2"O"$], [3.92 %],
    [$"Al"_2"O"_3$], [5.01 %], [], [$"K"_2"O"$], [2.98 %],
    [$"B"_2"O"_3$], [5.28 %], [], [$"PbO"$], [29.69 %],
    [$"SiO"_2$], [42.22 %], [], [$"CdO"$], [3.01 %],
    [], [], [], [$"Al"_2"O"_3$], [2.76 %],
    [], [], [], [$"B"_2"O"_3$], [7.80 %],
    [], [], [], [$"SiO"_2$], [47.51 %],
    [], [], [], [$"ZrO"_2$], [0.98 %],
    table.hline(stroke: 0.5pt),
    [], [100.00 %], [], [], [100.00 %]
  ))
]


One way for the production of these gold pink colours is that the powders of gold base and fluxes are sintered followed by milling to the application fineness. Fineness of these type of colours is e.g. (PSD curve) $D_(10) = 0.4 mu$; $D_(50) = 2.8 mu$ and $D_(90) = 10.9 mu$. Application of the colours is done manually (painting) or by method of screen print transfer. The numerous examples of red, lilac and dark red floral decors (mainly roses) started already in the early times of European porcelain production and continued till these times. UK had always a strong reputation for these types of floral designs as well as the famous German porcelain factories. The transfers with these gold pinks have always been very popular in the UK but also in East European countries like Russia and Ukraine where huge amounts of porcelain are used by tradition. Examples of some gold pinks are shown in @photo:gold-colours-transfer and @photo:gold-colours-manual.

From the above it may be clear that only gold onglaze decoration colours are developing the nice pink red colours but that no glazes can be made in a similar way.

Without doubt one can state that during the last 10 -- 15 years the (gold) decoration decreased dramatically in the European countries. The closing down of many porcelain factories in (Western) European countries and outsourcing production to Asian and other countries have a dramatic effect on screen-print transfer manufacturers particularly in Western Europe as well as decoration departments of porcelain factories. Now, it is very rare to see the rich and exuberant floral designs on porcelain which were a tradition in many households only some decades back.
