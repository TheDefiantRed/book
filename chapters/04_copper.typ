#figure(kind: "subtitle", supplement: none, numbering: none)[A wonderful red through ceramic conversion.]

As mentioned before, a completely different group of red coloured glazes are the reduction glazes. This type of glazes is achieved using copper as the main colorant while the glaze composition, and even of more importance, the specific firing conditions, are decisive for the final colour tone.

These glazes are mainly indicated with the name 'oxblood' glazes, 'sang-de-boeuf' glazes, 'copper reduction reds' and also 'Chinese reds'. It is generally assumed that the origin of these types of glazes must be searched for in certain parts of China and more in particular the north-eastern part of China, viz. the province of Honan where the Imperial Honan potters during the Sung dynasty made already beautiful copper-red glazed ceramic vessels.

The available literature#footnote[N. Wood. 'The evolution of the Chinese Copper Red'. In: 'Freer Gallery of Art Occasional Papers', Vol. 3, No. 1, Washington D.C.] is very positive that copper reds were not made occasionally at that time, but that it was the result of a deliberated effect and control of the kiln atmosphere.

'Copper reds' is the collective noun for all glazes where colloidal copper is responsible for the red colouring of the glaze. In these groups, however, one can distinguish different types which clearly vary from each other. The main types are the 'sang-de-boeuf' glaze or 'lang yao', the 'flambé glaze', the 'onglaze red glaze' and the so-called 'peach-bloom' glaze.

In respect of the development of Chinese ceramics one often holds over the following scheme:

  / Hsia dynasty (夏): $plus.minus$ 2000 BC. Many specimens are found from this early period also known as 'the painted pottery culture'. Black and red coloured earthenware.
  / Shang dynasty (商): 1766 BC -- 1122 BC. Mainly low fired earthenware but also grayish type of hard pottery with engraved decorations derived from cast bronze.
  / Chou dynasty (周): 1122 BC -- 225 BC. Grayish-brownish ceramics with sometimes a rather rough surface.
  / Ch'in dynasty (秦): 225 BC -- 206 BC. The so-called small dynasties. A decline from scientific point of view also regarding the ceramic development.
  / Han dynasty (汉): 206 BC -- 220 AD. First important period for the ceramic development. Red coloured earthenware with brownish-green lead glaze. A turning point was reached as appears from excavated vitrified stoneware vessels and glazed with what is called the forerunner of the later celadon glazes.
  / The "6 small dynasties": 220 -- 618. Development of celadon like the Yüeh ware. Influences of the near east countries can be noticed. During this period the precursor of the porcelain showed up thanks to the addition of kaolin to the body material.
  / T'ang dynasty (唐): 618 -- 906. Techniques with white glazes and engobes were added to the already existing ceramic knowledge. Some specimens are found of white porcellanous ware.
  / The 5 dynasties: 906 -- 960. During this period the potters of Yüeh reached their highest level regarding their grayish-green celadon glazes.
  / Sung dynasty (宋): 960 -- 1279. A culminating point for the Chinese ceramic development. During this period the white burning porcelain body came to development. Very admirable copper red glazes are made in this period.
  / Yüan dynasty / Mongol period (元): 1279 -- 1368. Continuation of the Sung development. Development of the application of cobalt blue under glaze decoration technique. These were indications for a technique which was fully exploited during the Ming period.
  / Ming dynasty (明): 1368 -- 1644. A 2nd flourishing time for the Chinese ceramics. This period is well known in the western European countries. The trading activities of the Portuguese and later on the Dutch resulted that these porcelain products became very popular. It is known that ships, fully loaded with this porcelain products#footnote[T. Volker. 'Porcelain and the Dutch East India Company'. Mededelingen van het Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde, Leiden, No. 11, 1954.], provided the western countries with the most beautiful porcelain. Shaping of jars, vessels, etc. reached a peak of excellence. Well known examples of this period are e.g. white porcelain painted in under glaze blue and the development of polychrome overglaze decorations.
  / Ch'ing dynasty (清): 1644 -- 1912. A period of refinement. During the reign of K'ang Hsi (1662 -- 1722) the several polychrome paintings known as famille rose, famille verte and famille noire originated. Copper red sang-de-boeuf glazes were made of a particularly deep and homogenous colour tone. Also so-called peach-bloom copper reds are dated from this period.

One must bear in mind that the Chinese, together with the inhabitants of two other river delta (from the Indus in India and from the delta's in the Near East) are said to be the carriers of the oldest human cultures. As far as the Chinese culture is concerned the literature#footnote[W. Willetts. 'Chinese Art'. Penguin Books, Harmondsworth, 1958.] makes mention of a start, most probably at the delta area of the river Hwang Ho, the Yellow River. The then inhabitants start moving inland, occupying the fertile stream area of the Hwang Ho, moved further mainly in western and southern directions and started settlements with an agricultural character. It did not take a long time before these settlements started producing ceramic objects. In this respect, but without having the intention to be complete, it is worthwhile to mention the following towns which all developed a strong tradition of ceramic production: Ting-chou, Tz'ŭ-chou and Chi-hsien in the province Hopei; Chang-an, Loyang and Lin-ju in Honan; Kaifeng in the province Kiangsu; Chin-tê-chên in the province Kiangsi; Lung-ch’üan and Yüeh-chou in the province Chekiang and others.

Several Chinese cultures were of great importance in respect of ceramic developments. The rulers at those specific periods seemed to have contributed a lot to these developments. In many cases the upper class instructed the ceramic artists to make the most beautiful types of vases, vessels and all kind of tableware. Illustrative for this is the story of T'ung, the God of the potters. The story is said to be derived from an old Chinese legend. During the reign of Wan-Li (1573-1619) a potter threw himself into his kiln for reasons that he could not fulfill an Imperial order for a particular glaze effect. Following the legend, these self-sacrifices resulted through that miraculous way that the required effect was obtained.

From the early times there were two main important oxides used for colouring by the Chinese potters. These two oxides were the iron- and copper oxides. Later on, other oxides became more important like cobalt oxide (first imported from Persia) during the Ming dynasty.

Although the ultimate intention of the iron and the copper oxide was and is a complete different one, they had the resemblance that reducing firing conditions were of great importance both for celadons and for copper red glazes.

It is ascertained that the iron oxide is responsible as the colour causing component in the several types of celadon glazes. The name celadon is said to be derived from Saladin, a sultan of Egypt who sent a number of pieces of this particular ceramic ware to Nur-ed-din, the sultan of Damascus in 1171. Another story for the derivation is from the shepherd Celadon, a character in a romance called l'Astrée and written by Honoré d'Urfé in the 17th century. The shepherd Celadon was wearing a coat in distinctive grayish-greenish colours.

Studies#footnote[M. J. Lime. 'Celadon Glazes'. Ceramic Monthly, Oct. 1974.] have demonstrated that the soft and warm appearance of the early celadons is caused by the fact that a relatively large number of air bubbles and non-dissolved glaze particles exist in the glaze. These are reasons for the scattering and reflection of light sources. Later dated celadons, e.g. from the Ming dynasty, differ from the earlier ones in that they usually have a more clear appearance. The so-called 'kinuta' celadons (Japanese name) are celadons with a blue colour tone. The presence of P_2O_5 in these ferrous glazes is said to be responsible for these blue colour tones. In this respect one also makes a comparison with the mineral vivianite: $"Fe"_3("PO"_4)_2 dot 8"H"_2"O"$. Another famous type is the spotted celadon, also called buckwheat celadons. For these types of glazes it seems to be a precondition that both Fe and Cu are present in the glaze.

During these processes the firing conditions were of a great importance in respect of the required glazes. Reducing conditions were absolutely necessary for the creation of these glazes. The way in which the Chinese potters were able to achieve those conditions could easily be reconstructed as these particular kilns still exist today. The kilns were usually built on a hillside where the slope of the ground furnished the necessary draught. Wood was mainly used as fuel. The wood smoke, which consisted of finely divided particles of carbon, was conducted into the kiln together with a limited quantity of air. In this way, a strong reducing atmosphere was created which was necessary to reduce the copper oxide to the finely divided metallic copper in a colloidal state. In a later stage, more in particular during the Ch'ing dynasty, a more sophisticated method was employed to obtain a reducing atmosphere. The well skilled potters developed a special type of saggers. The inner sagger in which the ware was placed was perforated. This in contrast with the outer sagger which was completely closed. The space between the saggers was filled up with charcoal. This method enabled them to exercise a better control in respect of the firing under reducing conditions. A.L. Hetherington#footnote[A. L. Hetherington. 'Chinese Ceramic Glazes'. Cambridge University Press, 1948.] indicates that only one-half percent of copper must be present for the development of the best copper reds. Under well-controlled conditions and carried out by well-experienced potters, these reds were created. These Chinese reds, known as the famous 'lang yao', thank their colour to cupric oxide which has been reduced to copper. This metal is then present in a very finely divided and colloidal state. Good representatives of this type of copper reduced glazes have a uniform deep red coloured glaze all over the vase or vessel.

Another type of copper reduced glazes is the so-called flambés. Many examples are dated from the 18th century. A general impression of these flambés is the always fascinating game of vertical lines composed on one hand by the dark copper red and on the other hand by a bluish coloured opalescense glaze.

The red copper glaze as an onglaze effect is from a different nature. In this case the red colour is not resulting from copper in the transparent glaze. The effect is mostly realized by the vaporization of copper salts like copper chloride. During the firing in a reducing atmosphere these copper vapours condense on the surface of e.g. a white glazed vase or vessel. It is rather difficult to obtain a homogenous and thin layer of condensed copper on the surface of the ceramic substrates. This technique is said not to be a Chinese one from origin.

A famous and one of the most beautiful and also rare groups of copper red glazes are the so-called peach-bloom glazes. As a characteristic of those glazes one can mention a soft pink coloured glaze with, in many cases, a lot of deeper red coloured spots. Sometimes a certain opalescense is quite common, while also green spots often appear. These green spots are explained as being caused by the oxidation of spots of metallic copper formed by the flocculation of the colloidal metallic copper particles. Ceramic vases showing the peach-bloom effects are remarkable for their rarity. This rarity is mostly explained by the fact that even well-skilled Chinese potters could not always find the way that all fits in.

It can be stated that some natural circumstances were a cause that the Chinese community was rather closed. The old silk route however provided that an exchange of various merchandise could take place between the products from the Far East countries and the Western Asiatic and Eastern European countries. Several towns thanked their growth and prosperity to the fact that they were a stop on the silk route. In such bargain-towns like Samarkand and Boechara in Oezbekistan, the Arabic influence can still be seen today in several buildings. Evidences for a trade vice versa along this silk route are also found during the excavation of Samarra on the Tigris in Mesopotamia. During the excavations in 1914 important fragments of Chinese porcelain was found in the ruins.

However, of greater importance in respect of the spreading of Chinese ceramics were the traders' activities of the Portuguese, soon followed by the Dutch. Especially the Dutch, after the establishment of the VOC (Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie), had a great part in shipping an important amount of Chinese porcelain to the West European countries. These trading activities made the various manifestations of Chinese porcelain well known and also very popular in the Western world. The Portuguese Jesuit priest Père d'Entrecolles lived at Ching-tê Chên during the reign of the emperor K'ang Hsi of the Ch'ing dynasty. He wrote several letters in 1712 and 1722 describing the potting techniques at that time#footnote[Père d'Entrecolles. 'Lettres édifiantes et curieuses'. Paris, 1780.].

    'This vase of apparently simple shape swells slowly as it rises from its foot. At the shoulder it contracts sharply, and at the neck there are three sharp-edged collars punctuating a point of union and breaking the glassy smoothness of the body of the vessel; the mouth spreads slightly. Beneath the glassy surface, one can detect subtle modulations from dull pink to red to grayish green --- the whole offering a seemingly infinite variety of nuances. In Chinese, the color is sometimes called kidney-bean red, and the shape is that of a "three-string vase" (after the rings on the neck). The vase was made as one of a set of eight different vessels, all intended for the scholar's table. There were flower vases of different shapes, together with vessels used for washing brushes and holding red seal-paste. The glaze is now thought to be the result of sandwiching a layer of copper pigment between two layers of clear glaze --- the end-product of a period of experimentation with copper red glazes that began in the late 17th century. The shape of the vase is an intellectualized and refined version of Sung Dynasty wares. Evidently there was court patronage; this vase may once have been owned by the first Prince I (1686-1730), thirteenth son of the K'ang-hsi emperor and ancestor of its 19th-century owner'.

It took till 1709 before Tschirnhaus / Böttger succeeded in making that kind of porcelain that could compete with the Chinese porcelain#footnote[R. P. Malcolm. 'Porcelain from the East to the West'. A lecture given for the English Ceramic Circle, London, 1958.]. From that time the developments in the western countries, mainly in Germany and France, went rather fast. The realization of the Chinese copper reds however requires a great experience and are to a great extent dependent on kiln conditions. Moreover, they are rather sensitive for temperature deviations and influences on the kiln atmosphere. For these reasons this type of glazes never reached a high production level. The realization, or maybe better the creation was and still is a specific challenge for the artist.

It is said that Ebelmen and Salvetat#footnote[Ebelmen; Salvetat. 'Annales de Chimie et de Physique'. Vol. 35, 1852.] were the first Europeans who were able to reproduce these type of glazes. Their examinations were published in 1851.

Other important investigations were undertaken in the 1880ies at Sèvres. Analyses were made of copper reds and published by G. Vogt#footnote[G. Vogt. 'La porcelaine'. Paris, 1893.]. According to these investigations, a typical analysis for a (fired) copper red glaze should read as follows:

Glazes according to this composition were fired at 1280 °C under reducing conditions. In this way a fairly good approach of the original Chinese reds was realized.

At the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century many publications appeared dealing with Chinese copper red glazes. There was even a tendency to produce porcelain more according to the analyses made from ancient ceramics. It is however understandable that in many cases they did not reach the richness and the originality of the old Chinese copper red glazes. Reasons for this are e.g. the methods of analyzing. Now, roughly a hundred years later, it may be stated that analyses made in that time did not had the certitude as they have nowadays. With the actual possibilities with regard to silicate analyses the final results can be more trusted.

Another reason is that one made use of the Western raw materials which are available in almost pure form. In many cases minerals were used where the Chinese potters used rocks (petuntse). Just the impurities as present in the latter play also an important role for the final appearance of the glaze. It is published many times that the way of firing can even be of more importance than the composition as such. At the same time this is one of the most difficult obstacles to tackle.

Important contributions in respect of the development, the realization and the chemistry behind the copper red glazes are published by e.g. Herman A. Seger#footnote[H. Seger. 'Gesammelte Schriften'. Verlag Chemisches Laboratorium für Tonindustrie, Berlin, 1896.], C. M. Harder#footnote[C. M. Harder. 'Red Glazes and Underglaze Red by Reduction'. J. Am. Ceram. Soc. 19, 26-28, 1936.], E. Breitenfeldt#footnote[E. Breitenfeldt. 'Experiments on Copper Red Glazes'. Keram. Rundschau, 37, 1929.], J. W. Mellor#footnote[J. W. Mellor. 'Chemistry of the Chinese Copper-red Glazes'. Trans. Ceram. Soc. 35, 1936.], Brown and Norton#footnote[Brown; Norton. 'Constitution of Copper-red Glazes'. J. Am. Ceram. Soc. 42, 1959.] and C. W. Parmelee#footnote[C. W. Parmelee. 'Ceramic Glazes'. Cahners Publ. Comp. Inc. Boston, 1973.].

All these investigations have contributed to a better knowledge and understanding of Chinese reds made through reduction of copper oxide. This offers the present artists a lead in their experiments but it is hardly imaginable that they will reach a higher level than the Chinese potters of the Sung dynasty. An example of copper red glaze can be seen on @fig:copper-red:
