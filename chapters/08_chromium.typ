The element chromium was in fact discovered when Johann Gottlob Lehmann found an orange-red mineral in the Beryozovskoye mines in the Ural Mountains in 1761. He called this mineral 'Siberian red lead' because he thought that it was a lead compound with selenium and iron. Later on, it appeared that he had found the mineral Crocoite which exists as leadchromate ($"PbCrO"_4$). See also @photo:crocoite-mineral.

A few years later Peter Simon Pallas visited the same location again and discovered that this 'Siberian red lead' was very suitable as pigment for paints. The good resistance properties of paints with lead chromate made the application afterwards very common and some examples of the warm and signaling yellow colour are very well known as i.e. the colour of the school busses in the USA and the house colour of Deutsche Post. In more recent times, the lead chromate based paints and colours have been substituted more and more by organic and lead free compounds due to environmental and safety concerns.

It was the French chemist Nicolas-Louis Vauquelin who in 1797 succeeded in isolating chromium oxide out of Crocoite by mixing the mineral with chloric acid. A year later he succeeded in making the metal chromium out of the chromium oxide by heating the material in a kiln. During the 19#super[th] century chromium became more and more important as metal in alloys to increase the properties of the alloys.

Very remarkable in this respect is that the application of chromium metal to increase the quality of metal alloy properties has already been applied by the Chinese. The tips of swords and crossbows as found in burial pits dating from the late 3#super[rd] century BC - Qin dynasty of the famous Terracotta army near Xi'an have been analysed by archaeologists. The ancient bronze tips showed no sign of corrosion due to the fact that the tips were coated with chromium#footnote[Maurice Cotterell. 'The Terracotta Warriors: The Secret Codes of the Emperor's Army'. Rochester; Bear and Company, 2004, ISBN 159143033X.].

The most important source for chromium is the mineral chromite ($"FeCr"_2"O"_4$) which is mainly found in South Africa, Kazachstan, Russia, India and Turkey. In 2000 an amount of 15 million tons have been mined which give about 4 million tons of the metal chromium.

The name chromium comes from the Greek word 'chroma' which means colour. For everyone involved in chemistry this may be clear given the numerous and different coloured compounds which are able to create with chromium. Also for people in ceramics it is clear. Chromium compounds and stains are a base for very different colours as green (chromium oxide; chromium silicate; chromium aluminium silicate), yellow (lead chromate), pink colours in chromium tin stains and, of course, chromium red glazes.

Chromium red glazes have been studied and developed from the early beginning of the 20#super[th] century. Some important studies and publications in this respect are from A. Berge: 'Rote Chromglasuren'#footnote[A. Berge. 'Rote Chrom Glasuren'. Sprechsaal 44, 581-584, 1911.]; from A. Heubach: 'Chromrote glasuren'#footnote[A. Heubach. 'Chromrote Glasuren'. Sprechsaal 46, 597-599, 1913.]; from W. A. Weyl and E. Thümen: 'Konstruktion und Farbe der Chromgläser'#footnote[W. A. Weyl; E. Thümen. 'Konstruktion und Farbe der Chromgläser'. Sprechsaal 66, nr. 12, 1933.]; from K. Grössl: 'Chromrote Glasuren bei SK 1a aus dem Dreistoffsystem $"PbO"-"SiO"_2-"ZrO"_2$'#footnote[K. Grössl. 'Chromrote Glasuren bei SK 1a aus dem Dreistoffsystem PbO-SiO2-ZrO2'. Interceram 25, H 2, 1976.]; from W. Wanie: 'Chrom als Farbstoff in Gläsern (Glasuren) und keramischen Farben'#footnote[W. Wanie. 'Chrom als Farbstoff in Gläsern (Glasuren) und keramischen Farben'. Sprechsaal für Keramik-Glas-Email, nr.8, 1962.]; from W. Lehnhäuser: 'Glasuren und ihre Farben'#footnote[Prof. W. Lehnhäuser. 'Glasuren und ihre Farben'. Wilhelm Knapp Verlag, 1966.] and from H. Balduin: 'Rote Chrom-Glasuren für erhöhte Temperaturen'#footnote[H. Balduin. 'Rote Chrom-Glasuren für erhöhte Temperaturen'. Keramische Zeitschrift, 28 Jahrgang, nr.6, 1976.]. All these publications describe the various influences of some raw materials, quantities involved, ratios for the various compounds, firing conditions, etc.

Important fact is that the red colour of chromium red glazes is caused by Cr-VI while Cr-III is causing the well known green colour. The chemical comparison: $2 "CrO"_3 arrow.l.r "Cr"_2"O"_3 + 3/2 "O"_2$ is in this respect important. What happens in wet-chemistry also happens in ceramic glazes: when a solution of a lead salt is being brought into contact with potassium chromate, a precipitation of yellow lead chromate is formed. When this solution is made more alkaline, the lead chromate is going over to a basic salt what is coloured red. This principle can be used to steer the colour of chromium glazes. Normally, the basis for chromium red glazes is a lead alumina silicate or a simple lead silicate.

The above mentioned can be proven when to such a chromium red glaze quartz is added in small steps. The colour of the glaze will go from the bright red into the green caused by $"Cr"_2"O"_3$ . Reason for this is that the more quartz is available, the more lead-silicate is formed leaving not enough lead for the forming of lead chromate and so the green colour of $"Cr"_2"O"_3$ appears. For that reason it is important for the formulations of chromium red glazes that the $"SiO"_2$ content is not too high (under or just over 1.00 in the Seger formula), that there is no boron, some alumina and some alkaline. An addition of tin oxide may help to create a more uniform red colour.

Chromium red glazes can approximate the appearance of CdSe colour quite close with regard to colour value. However, they are normally not stable at temperatures over 1000 °C. The best results are achieved therefore at temperatures as high as 900 °C till 980 °C in a normal / traditional firing cycle.

#recipe[
  A good and bright shiny chromium red is achieved on basis of a lead alumina silicate frit with composition:

  The composition of the glaze is:

      columns: (auto, auto, auto),
      stroke: none,
      align: (left, right, left),
      [frit], [62.50 %], [],

This glaze has been supplied e.g. to Ceramica SMOV in Italy during the 70ties of last century. They have applied the glaze onto a floor tile with high relief. In such a case one did not scratch the glaze too much because one is walking onto the relief of the tile itself (see also @photo:smov-floor-tile).

#recipe[
  Another very bright red chromium glaze with crystal building on the surface can be obtained in the following way using a lead silicate as basis:

    )
  )
]

#recipe[
  The composition of the glaze is (dry mix formula):

  #figure(
    table(
      columns: (auto, auto),
      stroke: none,
      align: (left, right),
      [frit (milled)], [78.0 %],
      [calcium carbonate], [3.2 %],
      [tin oxide], [7.8 %],
      [feldspar (Na,K) fine], [3.2 %],
      [potassium dichromate], [7.8 %],
      table.hline(stroke: 0.5pt),
      [], [100.0 %]
    )
  )
]

The glaze can be dry mixed with an intensive mixer, mixed with water and sprayed onto the biscuit fired surface. Firing temperature is 940 °C.

All these type of glazes have been developed and applied during the first half of the last century and partly till the 60ties and the 70ties. Although beautiful red glazes can be achieved, the negative aspects of these types of glazes became more and more important. Of course, the health aspect of using chromates and bi-chromates, the carcinogenic properties of Cr-VI, the necessary application of lead alumina silicates or just simple lead silicates, the vaporization of chromium compounds during the firing which can result in unwanted colour-effects and the very low chemical resistance which made these type of glazes only applicable for ceramic art- and giftware. With the industrial introduction and increasing possibilities of cadmium selenium glazes as from the mid of last century, the chromium red glazes disappeared and are now only applied in some rare cases by artists or some smaller potters.
