THE DEFIANT RED

a review of red coloured glazes

This review is intended as a contribution to the common knowledge of
producing so-called ‘pillarbox’ or ‘signal red’ glazes. It is commonly
known that – despite the long existing ceramic tradition in various
human cultures - the possibilities for successfully producing bright red
glazes on an industrial scale only become apparent after further
development and perfection of the systems based on the elements cadmium,
sulphur and selenium.

Besides the current method, seven other methods for producing red
colours are also reviewed. Some of these have long traditions like the
iron and copper reds. Some of the chromium based red glazes can
approximate the CdSe glazes in colour value. In general, however, one
can state that for all other methods the conditions necessary to create
a real red colour tone pose restrictions for applications on a large or
industrial scale.

PREFACE

Starting this review the intention in first instance was to review and
describe the existing manufacturing possibilities of the group of
cadmium selenium red glazes. Although it is by far the only way which
offers so many possibilities for the creation of real red colours in the
various area of the ceramic field, it is not the only one. With the idea
in mind to be more complete, it became more and more obvious to also
include the other existing methods’ contribution towards realizing
reddish colours in ceramics. Moreover, the section describing the
historical aspects also grew, slowly but surely. With admiration of what
has been explored and described by numerous historians and
investigators, I have tried to confine myself to the most relevant
literature and available studies. Realization of the long ceramic
traditions in various human cultures and their culminating points which
were reached over several eras dictates the importance of mentioning
these facts, albeit in more general terms. I must admit to exploring
some side roads which, in my opinion, are mentioned to complement the
overall view of the genesis of some red glazes.

The eight different methods reviewed cover the important existing
methods for realizing red coloured glazes. Two of them are by far the
most important in respect of their industrial applications. These two
are the reddish colours obtained by colour stains of the CrSn group and
the CdSe glazes.

The most typical red colour, represented by a wavelength of 614 nm and a
colour saturation σ of about 90, is however only possible to create when
making use of the facilities offered by the system of the CdSe glazes
and CdSe stains. This group of colours and glazes is well known by names
such as signal red, cinnabar, scarlet, madder red, lobster red, carmine
red, poppy red and pillar box red.

The importance of the CdSe glazes has increased considerably since the
end of the fifties and the early sixties of the last century when
improved methods were developed for the retention of the red colour
under normal industrial firing conditions. The available literature,
including patent literature, is somewhat limited in the area of
describing the practical application and manufacture of these glazes. It
is therefore hoped that this review will also contribute to this
knowledge.

Red colours have something defiant in their character but that was not
the only reason for this review. Under certain but different
circumstances I think I might have undertaken the same exercise for
blue.

With my sincere thanks to all who helped me to realize this publication.

1\. INTRODUCTION

Without doubt one can state that both now and in history the colour red
is a colour that holds great fascination. Something of this sense can be
felt when one sees the red colour gradations of an early sunrise or a
sunset on a bright summer evening. Accurate reproduction of such reddish
sky-colours posed great challenges for many famous artists in their
wonderful paintings. These colours, caused by the fact that when the sun
is low in the sky the blue and violet light is more refracted than the
red light by the atmosphere, were and are in this way a continuous
source of inspiration.

Red was for sure one of the first applied colours, if not the very
first. The abundant use of red ochre together with yellow ochre and
black for the famous prehistoric cave paintings like those of Lascaux
and Altamira are in evidence of this. The red colour was often
associated with blood and, more particularly, with the life-giving idea
of it. This can be illustrated by the linguistic reduction of the words
blood and red <sup>1)</sup>. In Sanskrit, the oldest Indo-European
language, the word for blood is rudhira. The first part of this word
appears also in other languages like e.g. Greek and Latin: erythros and
rutilus resp. for red. Also in modern languages this word shows up like
in the German ‘Rot’, the Dutch ‘rood’, the English ‘red’ and the French
‘rouge’.

From the earliest times humankind has attached strong attributes to this
colour. The main attributes meant here have to do with activity, action,
struggle and other strong emotions which can all be associated with this
never- tranquil character. An example illustrating the power of red is
the almost innumerable number of red flags. The so-called ‘Oriflamme’ of
Charles the Great, used on the battle fields is a well-known example.
Another outstanding example of the image of the red colour is the use of
the red flag whenever there is a struggle or a revolution, especially
when it is said to be a socialistic one. Even the red colour of the cap
of Little Red Riding-Hood is in this respect not accidental, but a very
conscious choice according to the explanation of psycho-analysts
(Fromm), psychologists (Bettelheim) and exegetes (Hans Ritz). This
psychological impact of the red colour is nowadays frequently used in
commercials and advertisements. Very fast racing cars are more
associated with the colour red than with any other colour.

The bright red colour was impossible to produce in ceramics before the
properties and possibilities with the cadmium, selenium and sulphur
compounds were fully exploited. Although there are several ways to
obtain reddish colours, not one of them has the properties as those from
the CdSe reds, not even close to them.

One of these properties is expressed in the data which are obtained when
measuring the colour with a filter- or tristimulus colorimeter. When
measuring a colour with this type of equipment the basic principle is
that the subject is exposed to a well-defined light source and that the
reflected light passes at least 3 filters. The exact transmittance of
the filters is

prescribed by the Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage (CIE), after
investigations by e.g. Guild and Wright. Modern colorimeters have more
e.g. 16 filters and are connected with a computer to perform the
necessary calculations. A terminal offers the possibility to visualize
the reflectance curve in a diagram and a connected printer gives the
curve instantly. In these cases the colorimeter takes over the role of
the human eye. This take-over has however only reference to those
physical properties of colours which follow the nowadays existing laws
whereupon colorimeters are based, whilst a colour judgment with the
human eye involves also the physiological-optical problems. The physical
properties are more and more laid down in laws after Newton published
his opinion that light can be conceived as a mixture of spectral
colours. Colour measurements refer only to these physical properties
such as wavelength, colour saturation, etc. A more physiological
approach was first given by Goethe (Zur Farbenlehre; 1810) while a more
recent representative in this line ranks e.g. Itten (Kunst der Farbe;
1961). It often means that colour measurements are applied as an
internal support parameter in the quality control area but that for
final acceptance of colours and coloured glazes the judgment of the
human eye is also taken into account.

The tristimulus values X (for red), Y (for green) and Z (for blue) are
concluded from the reflectance curve and one can calculate the
trichromatic coordinates x, y and z according to:

x = X / X + Y + Z

y = Y / X + Y + Z

The relative blue part is:

z = 1 – (x + y).

The x and y coordinates of the CIE system defines any position on the
chromatic diagram (see figure 1.)

When another variable, the Y value (lightness) is coupled with the
chromaticity diagram, the combination defines the exact place in the
spatial pattern of the CIE diagram. The dominant wavelength,
λ<sub>d</sub>, can be determined by lengthening the line between the
neutral point and the point as located by the x and y coordinates. The
point of intersection of this line and the curve of the spectral colours
gives λ<sub>d</sub> for that particular colour.

The distance from the neutral point till the point as fixed by the
chromatic coordinates x and y is a measure for the colour saturation σ.
The colours on the spectral curve have a σ = 100.

If one measures a typical example of a CdSe glaze prepared through the
method using a pigment (i) and through the melted-in method (ii), one
arrives at the data as given in Table I. For this measurement a
colorimeter of Zeiss, type RFC 16 was used. The colour is measured
through 16 filters. With these data one can determine the λ<sub>d</sub>
and σ for these colours.

Another type of colorimeter is the Hunterlab colorimeter, also including
advanced calculation equipment. This meter gives the colour values in L,
a and b and is also able to give the in-line colour difference according
to the CIELAB method in a fast way. When measured the same colour
samples (i) and (ii) as mentioned before with a Hunterlab type D 25 g,
the data is obtained as given in Table II.

Table II

|                  |        |        |        |

| CdSe sample (i)  | +30.46 | +52.69 | +19.05 |
| CdSe sample (ii) | +27.98 | +52.80 | +17.65 |

Although these data of the colour measurements of sample (i) and sample
(ii) are rather close, it is without doubt that a simple visual
judgment, even by inexperienced eyes, is sufficient to distinguish the
different nature of these two examples of CdSe glazes.

The typical colour characteristics of the CdSe glazes as shown in the
Tables I and II are clearer if they are compared with the results of the
colour measurements of some other typical representatives of components
which also create reddish colours in ceramics. For these colour
measurements the same Zeis RFC 16 colorimeter was used. The results are
given in Table III.

Table III

| CdSe sample (i)  | 0.637 | 0.327 | 612.0 | 90.50 | 9.67  |
| CdSe sample (ii) | 0.646 | 0.321 | 614.5 | 91.00 | 8.41  |
| CrSn red         | 0.581 | 0.314 | 618.0 | 72.00 | 2.59  |

| Cr red           | 0.545 | 0.355 | 601.0 | 73.50 | 18.25 |

As there are no colours which can be considered as standard colours for
the various mentioned reds, the glaze examples of Table III represent a
certain choice. This choice per colouring component was made in such a
way that the mentioned glazes clearly can be recognized as
representatives for that colour component. The glaze references as used
for these colour measurements are given in Table IV.

As mentioned before, these values illustrate more or less the typical
character of the CdSe colours. Only the red colour obtained through
chromium can approximate these values to a certain extent. However, the
special character and application possibilities of chromium red glazes
mean that these types of glazes are only applicable in the field of art
pottery. All other methods are unable to create the typical signal or
pillar-box red colours as those from the CdSe glazes. From the other
possibilities which can be used to create reddish colours like iron,
copper, nickel, gold, CrSn stains and sodium urinate, it can be
mentioned that they all create a colour which is typical for that
particular component. In most cases, the glaze requires a composition to
such a degree that indeed a reddish colour is obtained but that the
nature of the glaze is an absolute disadvantage in respect of industrial
application. Only the use of calcined stains of the CrSn type is quite
often applied.

The use of Se in glass compositions is known for a long time already.
The investigations of Rooksby resulting in the determination that the
red colour is caused by mixed crystals of CdS.CdSe and published in 1932
were an incitement for a more intensive and scientific approach of this
colour mechanism.

> 

The first application of CdSSe pigments were, besides the glass
colouring, as decoration colours to be fired at rather low temperatures
in a 3<sup>rd</sup> firing process. The majority of the CdSSe stains
were applied in plastics and only a very small amount found an
application in ceramics. Technical improvements made the pigments
suitable for higher temperatures when used in specific base glazes. The
use in enamel processing and low firing glazes became possible. These
classic types of CdSSe pigments could be applied till about 1020 °C in a
firing cycle of approximately 16 hours. The type of glaze to be used for
these CdSSe pigments was preferably a cadmium stabilized one. Several of
these types of glazes are mentioned in the literature <sup>2)</sup> and
developed by the ceramic industry.

Another significant step in the development of these colours is the
invention of the so-called encapsulated pigments. The first patent is
filed in 1973 and published in 1974.<sup>3)</sup> The nature of this
type differs from the classic type. The real bright red colour tones are
however difficult to achieve with the first generation of inclusion
pigments. It is a kind of contradiction: the ZrSiO<sub>4</sub> crystals
are necessary to protect the pigment but are also the reason that a too
high degree of covering power (whiteness) is formed caused by the
difference in refraction index between the amorphous glass and the
ZrSiO<sub>4</sub> crystals. Later developments in this sphere by the
British Ceramic Research Association have shown to be an improvement of
this ZrSiO<sub>4</sub> protected pigment type. Colour stains made
according to this patent show a real bright red colour. This improvement
is realized by a modified production process resulting in the fact that
all the single zircon silicate crystals contain some of the CdSSe
pigment. These types of encapsulated pigments contain therefore about 7
times as much cadmium as the first inclusion pigments <sup>4)</sup>.
This gives the pigment more firing stability while also the release of
cadmium is considerably lower than its predecessor <sup>5)</sup>.

After 2000 another generation of stabilized CdSSe pigments has been
developed in China. These pigments have a higher colour strength and
brightness and can be applied even over 1200 °C. It is remarkable that
the development of the inclusion pigments somehow stopped in the western
European countries and that a new generation of much stronger and
brighter pigments has been developed in China.

It is generally believed that a well known supplier of inclusion
pigments as e.g. the German company Broll Buntpigmente found the
investments necessary to develop this new generation of very strong
stains to be too high. It is not exactly known by the writer why the
Peoples Rep. of China came up with these very strong stains, but it is
assumed that severe laws and regulations in the western countries are
very much an obstacle for the production in the western countries and
that the production of these type of stains at manufacturers at e.g.
China is only possible by the lack of the same severe laws and
regulations regarding the working with and the production of
cadmium-containing compounds.

> 

The method of melted-in CdSe coloured glazes came to a real industrial
use during the late fifties and the sixties of the former century.
Through the years, an unremitting zeal has ensured that nowadays for
practically each and every firing cycle a variety of CdSe glazes is
available. Due to its better firing stability this type of CdSe glaze
has taken over the role of the classic pigmented CdSe glazes. The
conventional pigmented type of glaze has some disadvantages: the firing
temperature is limited, the colour stability is less compared to the
melted-in types and the glaze is sensitive for a less favourable kiln
condition. These were reasons that the improved melted-in type of CdSe
glazes replaced the pigmented types for industrial applications. Only
with the latest generation of very strong and bright CdSe pigments have
the earlier disadvantages been overcome. The high prices of these strong
pigments are however a block for a comprehensive application.

> 

In the dinnerware industry another advantage benefitted the melted-in
types: the lower figures for metal release and far within the limits as
prescribed by the standard DIN EN 1388-1/-2. As a typical representative
company which produces safe dinnerware using CdSe glazes of the
melted-in type counts e.g. the German company Wächtersbach now called
Keramische Fertigungstaette Brachtal GmbH. This company has produced red
glazed dinnerware for several decades already and it is e.g. meeting the
requirements for export to the U.S. Only in those cases where an
absolute lacquer-like appearance is required do the pigmented types
fulfill these requirements better than the melted-in types. In this
respect one can e.g. refer to the Fiesta dinnerware type called
‘Scarlet’ made in 2004 by Homer Laughlin (USA) which is produced with a
suitable transparent glaze and a strong CdSSe pigment from the last
generation.

> 

The wall- and floor tile industry used to only apply the melted-in types
of glazes. Nowadays, with the strong CdSe pigments available, these
pigments are applied as well to achieve lacquer-like red colours. In
particular, floor tile glazes require a special surface which can be
obtained through some mill additions. The melted-in type of glazes
tolerates these additions much better than the pigmented type with
respect to the retention of the red colour. It may also be stated that
it is commonly known that the higher the firing temperature and the
longer the firing cycle, the more difficult it becomes to retain the red
colour. The fact that nowadays CdSe glazes are available for 1200 °C and
over in a firing cycle of roughly 20 hrs shows how far the developments
have proceeded. The trend in the ceramic industry to apply faster firing
cycles is therefore less problematical with respect to stability and
retention of the colouring components. However, other problems remain
and therefore these types of glazes must always be treated attentively.

> 

The peak in application of cadmium selenium glazes was in the seventies
and eighties of last century when thousands of tons of cadmium selenium
glazes were produced per annum by the main West European manufacturers
and applied onto wall- and floor tiles, vases, dinnerware and giftware.
Colours are, however, also strongly dependent on colour trends for
interior textiles and follow e.g. the directions as given by the ICA
(International Colour Authority) and other organisations in this field.
Although today such huge quantities are not applied anymore, there will
always be a place also in ceramics for the application of red glazes.

2\. HISTORICAL ASPECTS OF RED COLOURS.

**Including some thoughts about colours other than ceramic red **

** colours**.

> 

Although red is called the colour of activity it is remarkable that the
ceramic industry had to wait roughly 8000 years before a more general
use and application of the so-called pillar box or signal red colour was
possible.

From the early glazed objects as e.g. found after the excavation of
ancient Babylon (mainly from 1899 till 1917), till the first half of the
20<sup>th</sup> century, there were several possible methods of
achieving reddish colours. However, none of them gave the typical bright
red colours as those based on CdSe.

Most of the bright red colours which were used in the past were all
based on organic combinations which made them unsuitable for ceramic
applications.

In this field it was already known for a very long time how to prepare a
typical clear red colour. Nowadays, only some of these old methods have
survived. Most of them are replaced by the synthetic colours.

Although not directly related to ceramics it is interesting to see how
some typical red colours were achieved in the past. Most of them are
replaced by synthetic colours which offer almost every desirable colour
possibility. An exception is of course Mother Nature: she still creates
the most beautiful red colours without any human influence.

> 

Several sources mention ‘kermes’ as the oldest recorded dye; a red
colour stain obtained from a particular coccus <sup>6)</sup>. Also the
name scarlet has in this respect a long tradition. It is the colour of
the dye cochineal, obtained from a special kind of louse. The word is
present in many languages. The origin of the word is explained as being
derived from the Persian word ‘sakirlat’ which indicated clothes dyed
with this colour. This can also been said from the Arabic ‘sagillat’.
The word can also been found in the Latin ‘scarlatum’, the old-French
‘escarlate’, the old-German ‘scharlach’ and the English ‘scarlet’.

> 

A long existing class of red and purple colours is e.g. the porfyrine
group (from the Greek porfyra = purple). In ancient times the old
Fenician town Tyros had already a famous purple production around 1200
BC. It is said that a certain kind of ‘whelks’ were the source for this
purple dye. This fact has also given the name to the philosopher
Porfyrios (Tyros 232 – Rome 305). His real name was Malchos but he was
called after the purple industry of his native town.

The basic colouring compound is metalloporfyrine. The metal ion can be
Fe, Mg, Cu, Zn, Co, etc. These types of compositions are found in
numerous, important organic compositions like hemoglobin (Fe containing
porfyrine complex), chlorophyl (Mg containing profirine complex) and
others.

Solutions of porfyrines have, just like those of pyrrole, the property
to colour deep red in a reaction with organic solvents and mineral
acids.

In medicine the complex zinc-proto-porfyrine (zpp) is also known as a
means to check a possible increase of lead in blood. However, if the zpp
factor is too high it is not necessarily caused by lead poisoning. There
are more factors which can lead to an increased zpp factor.

The porfyrine compounds play an important role in the hemoglobin. It is
well known that hemoglobin is important for the transport of oxygen and
the removal of carbon dioxide. The active group hematine forms part of
the hemoglobin and this plays an important role in the binding and
relinquishment of oxygen in the blood.

> 

The carotenoides are another group of yellow, orange till red colours
belonging to the group of tetraterpenes. A well known representative of
this group is carotene, responsible for the orange colouring of carrots.
Other representatives of this group of colours are responsible e.g. for
the yellow colour of the dandelion, the orange/red colour of tomatoes
and also for the yellow colour of the canary.

> 

Another organic possibility which was used to obtain a warm red colour
came from the roots of the ‘Rubia Tinctorum’. This plant was first
cultivated in Asia (India, Iran, Egypt), followed by the countries
around the Mediterranean. From the 16<sup>th </sup>century, the plant
was also cultivated on a rather large scale in France and The
Netherlands (mainly the south-west part). The dried and pulverized roots
were used for colouring wool and silk.<sup>7)</sup> The important
component here is alizarine (from the Arab word ‘al oesara’ = the sap).
The chemical compound responsible for the colouring is 1,
2-dihydroxyantrachinon (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). This
compound is intrinsically light coloured. When chemically bound with
metal oxides (Al, Zn) the real vivid red colours become possible to
produce. Similarly, clear red colours could be created. (figure 2).

In 1868 Graebe and Liebermann succeeded in producing alizarine
synthetically starting from coal tar. From that time the plant became
unimportant and later on the alizarine itself also. One of the
applications today of alizarine red is e.g. in the plastic industry but
only to a minor extent. The reasons for this are its inferior heat
resistance and its poor resistance to ultra violet light and chemicals.

Another way to obtain bright red colours was the so-called ‘orseille’, a

vegetable colour pigment prepared through extraction of various kinds of
lichen with ammonia.

The colouring component is orceine
(C<sub>28</sub>H<sub>24</sub>O<sub>7</sub>N<sub>2</sub>). This orceine
is the purified extract from the orseille. One of the families of lichen
which was important in this respect was the Rocella species. It is said
that the name (orceine as well as orseille) stems from Rosela, a rich
traders family from Firenze. They were trading with these types of
lichen pigments as early as the 14<sup>th</sup> century <sup>8)</sup>.
H. Musso <sup>9)</sup> succeeded in decomposing the orceine in 14
components in a chromatographic way. The main components are α-amino
orceine (C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>18</sub>O<sub>4</sub>N<sub>2</sub>) and
γ-amino orceine
(C<sub>28</sub>H<sub>24</sub>O<sub>6</sub>N<sub>6</sub>). As a colouring
agent it is almost completely replaced by synthetic colours. In the food
industry it is still used on a small scale.

Litmus is very similar to orceine and is derived from the same kind of
lichen.

> 

Similarly the famous Harris Tweed is said to be coloured with a type of
lichen. The reddish-brown colour is obtained with a lichen type having
the local name ‘crottal’. It is collected by the people living on the
Hebrides who still prepare the colour in a traditional way.

‘Brazil wood’ is a further example. For this aim the wood of the family
Caesalpina and Heamatoxylon was utilized. Its purified sap served as an
ingredient by the preparation of aluminium-, chromium- and zinc paints.
However, these paints were not resistant against acids, alkalines,
neither were they light-resistant (UV). Today they are completely
replaced by synthetic colours.

> 

Besides these and other vegetable sources of red-making colours, there
were also some animal-organic pigments in use. One on these was carmine.
This was prepared from the female cochenille lice. The lice were dried
and after boiling in water the colour was separated in the form of a
sediment. The colouring component is mainly carmine acid. To make it
more suitable as a pigment it was precipitated on a carrier, in most
cases alum.

It will be clear that there are a number of disadvantages with regard to
these natural colours. The production methods, the inferior resistance
to chemicals and UV light can be highlighted. The situation regarding
the production and application of organic colours changed completely by
the discovery of aniline. Aniline (from the Arab word anil = indigo
plant) is an amine derived from benzene by substitution of a hydrogen
atom by an amino group with the formula

Aniline was discovered by Otto Unverdorben in 1826. He succeeded in
isolating the component from the products obtained by a dry distillation
process of indigo. The preparation nowadays is done by reduction of
nitrobenzene with the help of iron filings and diluted HCl. Directly
after the distillation the aniline is colourless but due to the
influence of light a brownish colour appears. At temperatures as low as
-6 °C the aniline solidifies. It has a slight but unpleasant smell and
it is highly toxic.

> 

Aniline is a weak base with salts which can easily be hydrolyzed. The
hydrogen atoms of the NH<sub>2</sub> group can be replaced by alkali
metals. A typical and important reaction of aniline and the other aryl
amines is the formation of diazonium salts
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N<sub>2</sub>Cl by the influence of
HNO<sub>2</sub>. These salts are starting points for hydrazines and for
the important azo colours.

> 

Aniline is also the starting point for secondary bases from the type
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>-NH-CH<sub>3</sub> or
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>-NH-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub> and of tertiary
bases of the type
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>-N(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. These are
mixed bases because they are both aliphatic and aromatic. They are
produced by influence of alcohols on aniline under pressure in the
presence of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. The bases give under influence
of HNO<sub>2</sub> paranitroso combinations
ON-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>-N(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. These are
the starting points for azine and oxazine colours.

> 

All these organic colours, based on pure chemical reactions, have now
replaced the natural colours. There is no need here to point out that
the development of these colours could take place thanks to their
durability advantages over the natural colours.

> 

This picture of relieving and succeeding methods for red colouring can
also be recorded with regard to the methods on creating a deep red
colour in ceramics.

It can roughly be stated that the oldest methods made use of red

coloured clays (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). Notably it is not only the
use of red coloured

clays, but also the development of techniques which created warm and
deep red colours and which could only be duplicated after thorough
investigations and a lot of trial and error work during the first half
of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.

Iron is the most important natural colorant in clays. Together with some
other components like CaO, MgO and TiO<sub>2</sub> it gives specific
colours which are - among other things - dependent on the processing of
the raw materials and the firing conditions. The colouring properties of
iron compounds were already known and utilized before one could speak of
a ceramic use or tradition. Some well known earth colours such as yellow
and red ochre, sienna and umber exist in mixtures of iron hydroxide
(Goethite), clays and quartz. The iron compounds in sediments are
developed by weathering of iron-containing minerals. During the
formation of clay materials, the iron is partially built in. The main
part however is separated as iron (III) hydroxide which is rather
insoluble at an acidity of 6 or 7. In a publication of Fischer
<sup>10)</sup> he indicates the following compositions of some well
known earth colours:

Natural earth pigments

These types of earth colours were applied in paintings during the
late-Paleolithicum. As such they are the oldest type of paints and most
probably older than ceramics. The homo sapiens living in the
late-Paleolithicum have left us evidence of earth colours as can be seen
in the admirable paintings in beautiful red colours like those in the
caves of Lascaux, Altamira, Font de Gaume and others. The cave of
Altamira e.g. has a ‘room’ called the ‘Sistine chapel of prehistory
<sup>11)</sup> and the paintings of bulls, horses, deer and bison stem
from the Magdalénien (± 12000 BC).

> 

Although science cannot give an exact time or place were a society
started to use clay as building material or for food storing, there are
some historical clues that one of the oldest and common ceramic
industries existed in the Near East countries. This dated back some 7000
to 8000 years <sup>12)</sup>. Even before this time it was already known
how to make use of the plastic properties of clay. Many human and animal
figures are found at several human civilizations around the world. As
one example of the existence of a kind of pottery culture at a
completely different place, the so-called band-ceramic culture can be
mentioned. Under the leadership of prof. dr. P.J.R. Modderman excavation
and a study were made from 1950 till 1966 in Elsloo, a small village in
the Dutch province Limburg. In that place an ancient settlement was
found. With the active carbon method the settlement could be dated as
from 4400 till 4000 BC <sup>13)</sup>. The ceramic articles which were
found were rather simple, except the decoration. The decoration in the
form of engraved bands around the upper part of the pots and vases is so
typical that it has given the name to the inhabitants of these
settlements. The decoration of the oldest pieces was rather simple; the
latest vases show a very nice game of lines and points in wavy movements
around the vases. These types of settlements of the so-called ‘band
ceramic people’ are found in central Europe along the Danube countries
and in western directions following more or less the river Rhine till
the south-eastern part of what now is Belgium and The Netherlands.
<sup>14)</sup>

Another place with an early and famous ceramic tradition and more close
to the stream area of Euphrate and Tigris is the delta of the Nile.
Archeologists have found evidence suggesting that ceramic knowledge also
existed here, including special glazing techniques.

Dr. A. Berendsen <sup>15)</sup> indicates that the oldest known type of
wall tiles is found in Egypt and is dated from the 4<sup>th</sup>
millennium BC. In this respect the discoveries made in the complex of
Medinet-Haboe near Tell-el-Jahudi in the Nile delta are of a great
importance.

Steinbrecht <sup>16)</sup> mentions a discovery of a small statue at the
Nile delta in 1875 which represents a hippopotamus. The statue is made
from an earthenware type of body and glazed with a green coloured glaze.
According to the engraved hieroglyphics, the statue could be dated as
from 4000 BC.

Copper oxide was one of the main oxides used for colouring, resulting in
the old ‘Egyptian blue’ colours. The technique of inlaid work was
already applied in early times. Famous is a deep blue coloured bracelet
of Amenhotep III (abt. 1411-1375 BC). Sir Flinders Petrie has found
examples of faience which could be dated from the 18<sup>th</sup>
dynasty (1580-1335 BC). The different parts, as e.g. light blue coloured
corn flowers and a yellow coloured background, are made separately and
later assembled. Other well known specimens of an Egyptian ceramic
tradition are the King-cartouches. Since the reign of Seti I (abt.
1308-1298 BC) this method of making the cartouches appears popular. The
engraved parts are filled with glaze giving a beautiful array of dark
blue coloured parts and lines and the light blue coloured parts
appeared. The cartouche in faience technique of Ramses III, dated abt.
1180 BC is in the British museum in London <sup>17)</sup> and is a
beautiful example of this technique.

One of the explanations for the evolution of ceramic articles like pots,
vessels and vases is the ongoing necessity for storing food. Besides
evidence of ceramic pieces the fire places or kilns where the articles
were fired were also discovered. Vertical kilns, in which the potters’
ware did not come into direct contact with the flames, are found in
Mesopotamia and also in Iran <sup>18)</sup>. These kilns could be dated
± 4000 BC. The products from that time show that one was able, by
varying the thickness of one or more pigment containing layers, to
obtain polychrome coloured articles. Well known examples are found in
the northern part of Mesopotamia. One of the examples of this ancient
art of pottery is a plate with a diameter of 12 cm. It is polychrome
decorated and originated from the Tell Halaf period, found in Arpachiyah
and dated from 4500 – 4000 BC. It is only one example of the multitude
of data which are known today and which show clearly that from the
5<sup>th</sup> millennium BC the existence of rather high ceramic
standards.

> 

An important fact is that in the Middle East area, Assyrian power and
culture reached a high degree under several rulers. One of them was King
Assurbanipal (668 – 626 BC). He developed, like other Assyrian rulers, a
predilection to fix and collect scientific, religious and literary
texts. He also installed the famous Royal Library at Nineveh which
consisted of over more than 20,000 clay tablets. These clay tablets are
closely written on both sides in cuneiform. Thanks to these ‘ceramic
papers’ and the fact that they are not completely destroyed in this ever
turbulent part of the world, we know not only the famous Gilgamesh epos,
but also a lot of other valuable information. Most of these clay tablets
are now in the British Museum. Another clay tablet which is called the
‘Glassmakers Tablet’ and found in Tall’Umar (Iraq) is dated from the
17<sup>th</sup> century BC. It gives the earliest known description and
formulae for making copper-lead glazes and moreover their application to
earthenware articles. This famous clay tablet is also in the British
Museum and is catalogued under the number BM 120960 (photograph 2). The
tablet measures 3¼ x 2<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>16</sub> in. = 8.25 x 5.24 cm
and is a unique writing in the history of chemistry and more in
particular in the history of ceramics as it is the first known
description for the preparation of a glaze. The tablet makes mention of
a complete prescription for several glazes to be mixed and moreover how
to apply them to biscuit fired earthenware.

Other evidence of the same kind for early ceramic cultures is found
during the excavation of the Royal Library at Nineveh and dated as from
the 7<sup>th</sup> century BC.

From the translation of the so-called ‘Glassmakers Tablet’ which are
available, namely one of C. J. Gadd and R. Campbell Thomson
<sup>19)</sup> and another one of A. L. Oppenheim <sup>20)</sup>, it is
possible to get a view of the then present knowledge of glass- and glaze
techniques.

The text of the tablet is divided into five chapters. The first chapter
gives the receipt for ‘lead-copper’ glaze; the second chapter gives a
receipt for ‘Akkadian-copper’. Chapter three describes the handling of
the clay for the potter ware to be glazed. Chapter four mentions the
glazing, while the fifth chapter gives the signature which translation
reads as follows:

> 

‘Liballit-Marduk, Son of Ussur-an-Marduk, priest of Marduk, a man
(native) of Babylon, Month of Tebet, 24<sup>th</sup> day, year after
(which) Gulkishar (became) the king’.

Although Assyriologists had already succeeded to unravel Assyrian
cuneiform more than a hundred years ago, one can notice some differences
in the mentioned translations. Where Campbell Thomson mentions salpeter,
Oppenheims’ translation gives anzahhu-glass. Another difference is that
Campbell Thomson makes mention of lime, where Oppenheim mentions
antimony. Furthermore, a striking difference is that Oppenheim states
that the BM 120960 text gives ‘a prescription how to produce red-stone
coloured glass’. Following Oppenheim, chapter one gives the recipe for
Assyrian red-stone glass and chapter two the recipe for Akkadian
red-stone glass. R. Campbell Thomson, who has done a lot of work in
respect of investigation and translation of Assyrian clay tablets,
speaks of green lead-copper glazes in his translation. <sup>21)</sup>

> 

Only the fact that the tablet BM 120960 gives the oldest known ceramic
recipe makes it very remarkable, but if translations mention ‘red-stone
coloured glass’ it is of course worthwhile to see if this is the very
first recipe for a red glass or glaze ever. Therefore, some practical
work has been done following the translations mentioned and further
explanations as given by prof. Veenhof from the Assyriologic Institute
of the State University of Leiden.

> 

The BM 120960 glazes consist for the main part of a basic material,
called zukû-glass. It is generally supposed that the level of glass and
glass manufacturing was already that high that a further description of
this basic glass could be omitted.

Another explanation is also given, saying that the scribe did not speak
the true mind. A reason for the supposition that the zukû-glass had most
probably a simple composition is found in its philological connection
with ‘zakû’ which means ‘clear’. Investigations to the compositions of
early Babylonian glazes <sup>22)</sup> has shown that for copper
coloured transparent glazes a simple alkaline silicate glass was used as
basic material. As main alkaline component, sodium has been determined
via emission spectral analyses.

From the history of glass <sup>23)</sup> it is also known that the first
type of glass as applied in Egypt as well as in Mesopotamia had the same
compositions, namely the three basic components natural soda (called
nitrum by Pliny), calcium containing sand and the ash of the marsh plant
salicornia. It is also generally assumed that a deliberate separation
between glass and glazes for ceramic use appeared from the middle of the
16<sup>th</sup> century BC. Therefore, it can be supposed that the basic
components for glass as well as for glazes were generally the same.

Hecht <sup>24)</sup> has determined the influence of glaze components in
relation with the colour development in this type of glazes. From this
survey it is shown that pure alkaline silicate glazes with 3 mol
SiO<sub>2</sub> developed the most beautiful blue colours. Besides the
glaze itself, the body used is also important. This influence of the
body composition with regard to this type of glazes, often called
Egyptian or Persian blue, is described by M.M. French <sup>25)</sup>.
From these investigations the conclusion was drawn that quartz-rich and
calcium-poor bodies were favourable for the development of the blue
colour. W. Henze <sup>26)</sup> reports also that just alkaline silicate
compositions render good results. Also an alkaline-lead-silicate with
18% PbO develops a good ‘well-melted Turkish blue’.

> 

From the before mentioned examinations, it is plausible to suppose that
the base glass from the Glassmakers Tablet, mentioned as zukû-glass,
could have consisted of an alkaline silicate, e.g. in the mole ratio
alkaline : SiO<sub>2</sub> = 1 : 3 and where the alkaline is singly
represented by sodium. Presuming this, the glaze composition should have
been read as mentioned in figure 5:

The colour of the glazes of Table VI do not show much difference in
appearance and colour development when applied to several bodies. A
greater difference than that between the glazes is noticed for the same
glaze applied on different bodies as shown by photograph 3. For these
three articles the same glaze was used, namely the chapter one glaze
according to Campbell Thomson. The most beautiful blue colour,
reminiscent of the colour of Lapis Lazuli, was achieved using a body
with a composition as mentioned in Table VII:

Although series of trials were also performed in a gas-heated kiln
(natural gas) under reducing conditions, it was not possible to obtain
(copper) reduced glazes with a reddish colour. Only the blue colour as
well known from the ancient times showed up. Based on these facts it may
be supposed that the glaze as prescribed on the BM 120960 tablet may
have looked like the glaze on photograph 3. The BM 120960 Glassmakers
Tablet, some 3700 years old, may therefore be considered as one of the
first written ceramic recipes (although not a red glaze) and the start
of publishing and collecting of ceramic data.

The techniques of making warm and deep red coloured ceramics ware
reached another culminating point during the Greek and Roman
civilizations.

Ir. A.J. Rijken <sup>27)</sup> correctly observed that in this respect
there is a lot of confusion about the designation of the slibs used for
this process. Besides the group of glazes and engobes he named the group
of layers necessary to create the typical red and black glazes ‘slip
glazes’.

As an example of slip glazes Rijken mentioned the Terra Sigillata, the
mostly red earthenware of the Romans which is covered with a very thin
glossy layer.

This Terra Sigillata was first made in Arezzo, mainly from 50 BC till 70
AD. This special way of manufacturing founds its way through several
Gallic districts till the regions along the river Rhine. It took a long
time before one could clarify the manufacturing of this typical
earthenware product. One of the difficulties was the very thin cover
layer (0.015 mm). With the possibilities of more modern investigation
methods one could finally approximate the manufacturing of Terra
Sigillata.

Neumann published in 1932 the attempts which were undertaken so far. The
glossy surface indicated that fluxing materials must be present.
Analyses revealed that the glossy layer contained principally less
SiO<sub>2</sub>, more Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, more
Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and more alkaline materials than the
surrounding body. No boron could be found. The firing temperature was
determined to be 850 °C till 1000 °C.

Progress was made by Nuissl who performed trials by slibbing up the red
coloured clays and separated the coarse particles from the fine
particles.

Schumann continued in this way and made trials with peptisators to
accomplish a better separation of the fine clay particles. With the
finest clay particles he succeeded in making a good approximation of the
original Terra Sigillata. With the help of X-ray diffraction analyses it
could be determined that only clays of the muscovite type,
KAl<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>AlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>10</sub> were
suitable to obtain the real effect. This type of clay minerals has K in
its structure <sup>28)</sup>, a point differentiating it from kaolinite
and montmorillonite.

Adam Winter <sup>29)</sup> named these ancient surface-layers
‘Glanztonfilm’ with the typical remark that there is no melting flux
added. The gloss should be caused by the ‘parallel geschichtete
Anordnung der blättchenformigen Tonminerale’.

By slibbing-up one could obtain the finest particles and applied to a
suitable and well treated body it was possible to reach a good looking
copy of the Terra Sigillata. An oxidizing atmosphere resulted in the
beautiful bright red colours, while a reducing atmosphere resulted in
dark brown to black colours.

This is also the explanation for the red and black colours of the Greek
ceramic vases.

Durand-Gréville was the first who discovered in 1891 that the black
layer remained black after heating in the absence of oxygen. When oxygen
was added during the heating process, the black colour turned red.

Attempts of Charles Binns and Fraser, published in 1929 in the American
Journal of Archaeology, lead to the following hypothesis: the Greek
heated their ceramic ware to roughly 600 °C in an oxidizing atmosphere.
After reaching this temperature they continued the firing till about 950
°C in a reducing atmosphere. After obtaining this temperature one
started cooling in a reducing atmosphere till approximately 850 °C after
which oxygen was admitted. The black iron oxide parts which were
enclosed by the glassy material could not change anymore in the
oxidizing atmosphere. The porous body itself however (the places not
treated with the slib glaze) turned again into red during the oxidizing
cooling from about 850 °C till room temperature. In this way one could
obtain both black and red colours in one and the same firing. It is
determined that the oldest Greek vases show black figures against a red
background. Lateron, red figures against a black background were also
made.

> 

Interesting investigations to clarify the processes which deal with
Terra Sigillata making and firing are done among other things by A.
Winter <sup>30)</sup> and F. Oberlies and N. Köppen <sup>31)</sup>.

> 

This technique with the slib glazes reached an absolute culminating
point during the Greek period roughly from 550 BC till 400 BC and the
Roman manufacturing of Terra Sigillata. After the 3<sup>rd</sup> century
this application disappeared completely as far as the civilizations
under Roman influence were concerned. In other early civilizations like
those of the Indus-dale it was and still is quite common to make use of
coloured, engobe-like layers, besides the use of the very same copper
blue glazes of Sindh in northern India and the ceramic ware as found in
Mohendscho-Daro and Harappa (abt. 3000 BC) are evidence for the
existence of an important and also well-developed and regularly ceramic
production. <sup>32)</sup>

> 

Besides these still beautiful red colour of the Terra Sigillata from the
past there are also today iron red colours used in ceramics. One of them
is as onglaze decoration colour also called Venetian Red. This is a red
onglaze colour for application at about 780 °C – 800 °C in a cycle of 5
to 6 hours also known as the classical porcelain onglaze firing. The
Venetian Red is in most cases built up with one or more suitable fluxes
and an iron compound which in most cases is an iron oxide.

> For a leaded onglaze iron-red colour one can use fluxes with
> compositions like:

(i) Na<sub>2</sub>O 0.074 B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.197
SiO<sub>2</sub> 1.480

>  PbO 0.781 ZrO<sub>2</sub> 0.050

>  CdO 0.072 TiO<sub>2</sub> 0.076<sub> </sub>

>  NaF 0.073

> 

In combination with a flux like:

(ii) Na<sub>2</sub>O 0.535 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.150
SiO<sub>2</sub> 2.533

>  K<sub>2</sub>O 0.055 B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.548 ZrO<sub>2</sub>

>  CaF<sub>2</sub> 0.060 TiO<sub>2</sub> 0.077

>  PbO 0.212

>  ZnO 0.082

>  CdO 0.056

These fluxes can be used together in a formulation to obtain the best
possible firing range. Combination e.g. can be between 50 and 70 for
flux (i) and between 40 and 20 parts for flux (ii).

Together with a specific type of iron oxide in a weight percentage of
10% one obtains a good iron-red colour.

> 

These iron-red colours are also available in an unleaded composition. In
those cases one can use a flux composition like:

> 

>  Li<sub>2</sub>O 0.325 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.155
> SiO<sub>2</sub> 2.555

>  Na<sub>2</sub>O 0.460 B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.985
> ZrO<sub>2</sub> 0.015

>  K<sub>2</sub>O 0.095 TiO<sub>2</sub> 0.010

>  BaO 0.035

>  ZnO 0.085

Together with e.g. 10 to 12 parts of a suitable iron oxide one obtains a
reddish/brown colour which is in fact far away from the real CdSe red
colours. Unleaded iron red colours are even more brownish compared to
the leaded versions.

This type of iron red decoration colours are commercially available and
cost-wise more attractive compared to gold-containing or CdSe based red
colours.

Also on roof tiles one still applies iron-red coloured glazes today,
often called ‘wine red’ glazes. The various roof tile companies in The
Netherlands and Germany still manufacture these iron-red colours which
all have a more maroon-like appearance instead of a clear red colour.

For a leaded composition one can use a lead-aluminium-silicate like e.g.

> 

>  PbO 1.000 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.244 SiO<sub>2</sub> 2.052

or in combination with the following frit:

>  PbO 1.000 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.300 SiO<sub>2</sub> 2.200

>  B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.600 <sub> </sub>

and e.g. 6 to 8 parts of a suitable red iron oxide type together with
some quartz, a clay with good setting-up properties and some bentone EW.

> 

As leaded glazes, also for roof tiles, become less and less popular due
to various health and environmental regulations, the tendency to apply
unleaded glazes is also increasing here.

For an unleaded type of iron-red glaze one can use an unleaded frit
composition like: (see also Yulia Shteinberg ‘Strontium Glazes’)

> 

>  Na<sub>2</sub>O 0.370 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.244
> SiO<sub>2</sub> 3.300

>  K<sub>2</sub>O 0.110 B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.390

>  MgO 0.135

>  BaO 0.115

>  SrO 0.270

> 

and e.g. 12 to 16 parts of a suitable red iron oxide together with some
quartz and a clay with good setting-up properties. These types of
unleaded wine-red glazes will always have more covering power and
somewhat less brilliance compared to the leaded compositions.

> 

Another application for iron red glazes is e.g. as floor tile glazes
which were used especially during the 70ties and 80ties of last century.
The trend in those days was very much for leather-like glazes in all
kinds of colour variations, applied in various layers. In most cases
these floor tile glazes were applied by (double) disc and fired in
roller kilns (e.g. Sacmi) in a cycle of 1150 °C - 50 minutes total
firing time. A good iron red composition in this respect is e.g.:

>  frit 37080 (Ferro) 30 parts

>  frit 37025 (Ferro) 20

>  frit 35310 (Ferro) 10

>  quartz 6

>  zircon silicate 17

>  titanium oxide 10

>  zinc oxide 3

>  iron oxide red 4

This glaze has a clearly iron-red appearance <sup>33)</sup>. It can be
turned into a matt glaze by adding a combination of 5 parts of
wollastonite and 5 parts of barium carbonate. Exact quantities depend on
the required colour and mattnes of the glaze.

Red coloured glazes were also used for a very long time in Japan for
their small mosaic tiles. The use of these tiles was popular in the
whole Far East region. One of the reasons was that Japanese technicians
(for kilns, glazes, etc.) brought this technique over to countries such
as Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. The colour is not as brilliant as
the colours obtained with CdSe glazes and also not with the colours of
CrSn based stains. However, the cost price was significantly lower which
was an important factor in choosing Fe based glazes. For floor- and wall
tiles a glaze like

> 

frit 34670 Ferro 85 parts

>  bayferrox 130M 10

>  sodium feldspar 7

>  kaolin 8

> 

was used for firing in a Riedhammer tunnelkiln at 1060 °C -1070 °C for
24 hours. As a general rule here one can state that a longer firing
cycle results in a more clear and brilliant red colour. This is
especially the case for the small mosaic tiles which were fired at e.g.
1280 °C for 28 hours. As the manufacturers tried to decrease the firing
temperatures for economical reasons to e.g. 1190 °C, it was not possible
to obtain the very same clear bright Fe red colour. Important parameters
in this respect are the presence of barium and magnesium in the glaze
and the type of iron oxide which must be very fine <sup>34)</sup>.

Nowadays, these types of glazes are not as popular anymore. Especially,
the tile manufacturers and more specifically the workers on the glazing
lines do not regret this. Anyone who has worked with iron-red glazes in
production knows that it is a ‘dirty’ part of ceramic production,
although even the famous American writer John Updike has said: ‘Ceramic,
muddy Queen of Human Arts’ in his poem ‘Dance of the Solids’
<sup>35)</sup>.

4\. COPPER

A wonderful red through ceramic conversion.

> 

As mentioned before, a completely different group of red coloured glazes
are the reduction glazes. This type of glazes is achieved using copper
as the main colorant while the glaze composition, and even of more
importance, the specific firing conditions, are decisive for the final
colour tone.

> 

These glazes are mainly indicated with the name ‘oxblood’ glazes,
‘sang-deboeuf’ glazes, ‘copper reduction reds’ and also ‘Chinese reds’.
It is generally assumed that the origin of these types of glazes must be
searched for in certain parts of China and more in particular the
north-eastern part of China, viz. the province of Honan where the
Imperial Honan potters during the Sung dynasty made already beautiful
copper-red glazed ceramic vessels.

The available literature <sup>36)</sup> is very positive that copper
reds were not made occasionally at that time, but that it was the result
of a deliberated effect and control of the kiln atmosphere.

‘Copper reds’ is the collective noun for all glazes where colloidal
copper is responsible for the red colouring of the glaze. In these
groups, however, one can distinguish different types which clearly vary
from each other. The main types are the ‘sang-de-boeuf’ glaze or ‘lang
yao’, the ‘flambé glaze’, the ‘onglaze red glaze’ and the so-called
‘peach-bloom’ glaze.

> 

In respect of the development of Chinese ceramics one often holds over
the following scheme:

± 2000 BC Hia dynasty

>  Many specimens are found from this early

>  period also known as ‘the painted pottery

>  culture’. Black and red coloured earthenware.

1766 BC  - 1122 BC Shang dynasty

>  Mainly low fired earthenware but also grayish

>  type of hard pottery with engraved decorations

>  derived from cast bronze.

1122 BC  - 225 BC Tsjow dynasty

>  Grayish-brownish ceramics with sometimes a

>  rather rough surface.

225 BC  - 206 BC The so-called small dynasties (Tsjin). A decline

from scientific point of view also regarding the

ceramic development.

206 BC  - 220 AD Han dynasty

>  First important period for the ceramic

>  development. Red coloured earthenware with

>  brownish-green lead glaze. A turning point was

>  reached as appears from excavated vitrified

>  stoneware vessels and glazed with what is called

>  the forerunner of the later celadon glazes.

220  - 618 The so-called ‘6 small dynasties’. Development

of celadon like the Yüeh ware. Influences of the

near east countries can be noticed. During this

period the precursor of the porcelain showed up

thanks to the addition of kaolin to the body

material.

618  - 906 T’ang dynasty. Techniques with white glazes

and engobes were added to the already existing

ceramic knowledge. Some specimens are found

of white porcellanous ware.

906  - 960 The 5 dynasties. During this period the potters

of Yüeh reached their highest level regarding

their grayish-green celadon glazes.

960  - 1279 Sung dynasty. A culminating point for the

Chinese ceramic development. During this

period the white burning porcelain body came to

development. Very admirable copper red glazes

are made in this period.

1279  - 1368 Yüan dunasty / Mongol period.

>  Continuation of the Sung development.

>  Development of the application of cobalt blue

>  under glaze decoration technique. These were

>  indications for a technique which was fully

>  exploited during the Ming period.

1368  - 1644 Ming dynasty.

>  A 2<sup>nd</sup> flourishing time for the Chinese ceramics.

>  This period is well known in the western

>  European countries. The trading activities of the

>  Portuguese and later on the Dutch resulted that

>  these porcelain products became very popular. It

>  Shaping of jars, vessels, etc. reached a peak of

>  excellence. Well known examples of this

>  period are e.g. white porcelain painted in under

>  glaze blue and the development of polychrome

>  overglaze decorations.

1644  - 1912 Ch’ing dynasty. A period of refinement. During

the reign of K’ang Hai (1662 – 1722) the

several polychrome paintings known as famille

rose, famille verte and famille noire originated.

Copper red sang-de-boeuf glazes were made of a

>  Also so-called peach-bloom copper reds are

>  dated from this period.

> 

One must bear in mind that the Chinese, together with the inhabitants of
two other river delta (from the Indus in India and from the delta’s in
the Near East) are said to be the carriers of the oldest human cultures.
As far as the Chinese culture is concerned the literature <sup>38)</sup>
makes mention of a start, most probably at the delta area of the river
Hwang Ho, the Yellow River. The then inhabitants start moving inland,
occupying the fertile stream area of the Hwang Ho, moved further mainly
in western and southern directions and started settlements with an
agricultural character. It did not take a long time before these
settlements started producing ceramic objects. In this respect, but
without having the intention to be complete, it is worthwhile to mention
the following towns which all developed a strong tradition of ceramic
production: Ting-chou, Tz’ŭ-chou and Chi-hsien in the province Hopei;
Chang-an, Loyang and Lin-ju in Honan; Kaifeng in the province Kiangsu;
Chin-tê-chên in the province Kiangsi; Lung-ch’üan and Yüeh-chou in the
province Chekiang and others.

Several Chinese cultures were of great importance in respect of ceramic
developments. The rulers at those specific periods seemed to have
contributed a lot to these developments. In many cases the upper class
instructed the ceramic artists to make the most beautiful types of
vases, vessels and all kind of tableware. Illustrative for this is the
story of T’ung, the God of the potters. The story is said to be derived
from an old Chinese legend. During the reign of Wan-Li (1573-1619) a
potter threw himself into his kiln for reasons that he could not fulfill
an Imperial order for a particular glaze effect. Following the legend,
these self-sacrifices resulted through that miraculous way that the
required effect was obtained.

From the early times there were two main important oxides used for
colouring by the Chinese potters. These two oxides were the iron- and
copper oxides. Later on, other oxides became more important like cobalt
oxide (first imported from Persia) during the Ming dynasty.

Although the ultimate intention of the iron and the copper oxide was and
is a complete different one, they had the resemblance that reducing
firing conditions were of great importance both for celadons and for
copper red glazes.

It is ascertained that the iron oxide is responsible as the colour
causing component in the several types of celadon glazes. The name
celadon is said to be derived from Saladin, a sultan of Egypt who sent a
number of pieces of this particular ceramic ware to Nur-ed-din, the
sultan of Damascus in 1171. Another story for the derivation is from the
shepherd Celadon, a character in a romance called l’Astrée and written
by Honoré d’Urfé in the 17<sup>th</sup> century. The shepherd Celadon
was wearing a coat in distinctive grayish-greenish colours.

Studies <sup>39)</sup> have demonstrated that the soft and warm
appearance of the early celadons is caused by the fact that a relatively
large number of air bubbles and non-dissolved glaze particles exist in
the glaze. These are reasons for the scattering and reflection of light
sources. Later dated celadons, e.g. from the Ming dynasty, differ from
the earlier ones in that they usually have a more clear appearance. The
so-called ‘kinuta’ celadons (Japanese name) are celadons with a blue
colour tone. The presence of P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> in these ferrous
glazes is said to be responsible for these blue colour tones. In this
respect one also makes a comparison with the mineral vivianite:
Fe<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.8H<sub>2</sub>O. Another
famous type is the spotted celadon, also called buckwheat celadons. For
these types of glazes it seems to be a precondition that both Fe and Cu
are present in the glaze.

During these processes the firing conditions were of a great importance
in respect of the required glazes. Reducing conditions were absolutely
necessary for the creation of these glazes. The way in which the Chinese
potters were able to achieve those conditions could easily be
reconstructed as these particular kilns still exist today. The kilns
were usually built on a hillside where the slope of the ground furnished
the necessary draught. Wood was mainly used as fuel. The wood smoke,
which consisted of finely divided particles of carbon, was conducted
into the kiln together with a limited quantity of air. In this way, a
strong reducing atmosphere was created which was necessary to reduce the
copper oxide to the finely divided metallic copper in a colloidal state.
In a later stage, more in particular during the Ch’ing dynasty, a more
sophisticated method was employed to obtain a reducing atmosphere. The
well skilled potters developed a special type of saggers. The inner
sagger in which the ware was placed was perforated. This in contrast
with the outer sagger which was completely closed. The space between the
saggers was filled up with charcoal. This method enabled them to
exercise a better control in respect of the firing under reducing
conditions. A.L. Hetherington <sup>40)</sup> indicates that only
one-half percent of copper must be present for the development of the
best copper reds. Under well-controlled conditions and carried out by
well-experienced potters, these reds were created. These Chinese reds,
known as the famous ‘lang yao’, thank their colour to cupric oxide which
has been reduced to copper. This metal is then present in a very finely
divided and colloidal state. Good representatives of this type of copper
reduced glazes have a uniform deep red coloured glaze all over the vase
or vessel.

Another type of copper reduced glazes is the so-called flambés. Many
examples are dated from the 18<sup>th</sup> century. A general
impression of these flambés is the always fascinating game of vertical
lines composed on one hand by the dark copper red and on the other hand
by a bluish coloured opalescense glaze.

The red copper glaze as an onglaze effect is from a different nature. In
this case the red colour is not resulting from copper in the transparent
glaze. The effect is mostly realized by the vaporization of copper salts
like copper chloride. During the firing in a reducing atmosphere these
copper vapours condense on the surface of e.g. a white glazed vase or
vessel. It is rather difficult to obtain a homogenous and thin layer of
condensed copper on the surface of the ceramic substrates. This
technique is said not to be a Chinese one from origin.

A famous and one of the most beautiful and also rare groups of copper
red glazes are the so-called peach-bloom glazes. As a characteristic of
those glazes one can mention a soft pink coloured glaze with, in many
cases, a lot of deeper red coloured spots. Sometimes a certain
opalescense is quite common, while also green spots often appear. These
green spots are explained as being caused by the oxidation of spots of
metallic copper formed by the flocculation of the colloidal metallic
copper particles. Ceramic vases showing the peach-bloom effects are
remarkable for their rarity. This rarity is mostly explained by the fact
that even well-skilled Chinese potters could not always find the way
that all fits in.

It can be stated that some natural circumstances were a cause that the
Chinese community was rather closed. The old silk route however provided
that an exchange of various merchandise could take place between the
products from the Far East countries and the Western Asiatic and Eastern
European countries. Several towns thanked their growth and prosperity to
the fact that they were a stop on the silk route. In such bargain-towns
like Samarkand and Boechara in Oezbekistan, the Arabic influence can
still be seen today in several buildings. Evidences for a trade vice
versa along this silk route are also found during the excavation of
Samarra on the Tigris in Mesopotamia. During the excavations in 1914
important fragments of Chinese porcelain was found in the ruins.

However, of greater importance in respect of the spreading of Chinese
ceramics were the traders’ activities of the Portuguese, soon followed
by the Dutch. Especially the Dutch, after the establishment of the VOC
(Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie), had a great part in shipping an
important amount of Chinese porcelain to the West European countries.
These trading activities made the various manifestations of Chinese
porcelain well known and also very popular in the Western world. The
Portuguese Jesuit priest Père d’Entrecolles lived at Ching-tê Chên
during the reign of the emperor K’ang His of the Ch’ing dynasty. He
wrote several letters in 1712 and 1722 describing the potting techniques
at that time <sup>41)</sup>.

‘This vase of apparently simple shape swells slowly as it rises from its
foot. At the shoulder it contracts sharply, and at the neck there are
three sharp-edged collars punctuating a point of union and breaking the
glassy smoothness of the body of the vessel; the mouth spreads slightly.
Beneath the glassy surface, one can detect subtle modulations from dull
pink to red to grayish green - the whole offering a seemingly infinite
variety of nuances. In Chinese, the color is sometimes called
kidney-bean red, and the shape is that of a "three-string vase" (after
the rings on the neck). The vase was made as one of a set of eight
different vessels, all intended for the scholar's table. There were
flower vases of different shapes, together with vessels used for washing
brushes and holding red seal-paste. The glaze is now thought to be the
result of sandwiching a layer of copper pigment between two layers of
clear glaze- the end-product of a period of experimentation with copper
red glazes that began in the late 17th century. The shape of the vase is
an intellectualized and refined version of Song \[Sung\] Dynasty wares.
Evidently there was court patronage; this vase may once have been owned
by the first Prince Yi \[I\] (1686-1730), thirteenth son of the Kangxi
\[K'ang-hsi\] emperor and ancestor of its 19th-century owner’.

It took till 1709 before Tschirnhaus / Böttger succeeded in making that
kind of porcelain that could compete with the Chinese porcelain
<sup>42)</sup>. From that time the developments in the western
countries, mainly in Germany and France, went rather fast. The
realization of the Chinese copper reds however requires a great
experience and are to a great extent dependent on kiln conditions.
Moreover, they are rather sensitive for temperature deviations and
influences on the kiln atmosphere. For these reasons this type of glazes
never reached a high production level. The realization, or maybe better
the creation was and still is a specific challenge for the artist.

It is said that Ebelman and Salvetat <sup>43)</sup> were the first
Europeans who were able to reproduce these type of glazes. Their
examinations were published in 1851.

Other important investigations were undertaken in the 1880ies at Sèvres.
Analyses were made of copper reds and published by G. Vogt
<sup>44)</sup>. According to these investigations, a typical analysis
for a (fired) copper red glaze should read as follows:

Na<sub>2</sub>O 2.71 %

>  K<sub>2</sub>O 4.79 %

>  CaO 9.00 %

>  MgO 1.65 %

>  PbO 3.90 %

>  CuO 0.54 %

>  Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.91 %

>  Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 6.57 %

>  SiO<sub>2</sub> 70.18 %

>  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

>  100.25 %

> 

Glazes according to this composition were fired at 1280 °C under
reducing conditions. In this way a fairly good approach of the original
Chinese reds was realized.

At the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century and the beginning of the
20<sup>st</sup> century many publications appeared dealing with Chinese
copper red glazes. There was even a tendency to produce porcelain more
according to the analyses made from ancient ceramics. It is however
understandable that in many cases they did not reach the richness and
the originality of the old Chinese copper red glazes. Reasons for this
are e.g. the methods of analyzing. Now, roughly a hundred years later,
it may be stated that analyses made in that time did not had the
certitude as they have nowadays. With the actual possibilities with
regard to silicate analyses the final results can be more trusted.

Another reason is that one made use of the Western raw materials which
are available in almost pure form. In many cases minerals were used
where the Chinese potters used rocks (petuntse). Just the impurities as
present in the latter play also an important role for the final
appearance of the glaze. It is published many times that the way of
firing can even be of more importance than the composition as such. At
the same time this is one of the most difficult obstacles to tackle.

Important contributions in respect of the development, the realization
and the chemistry behind the copper red glazes are published by e.g.
Herman A. Seger <sup>45)</sup>, C. M. Harder <sup>46)</sup>, E.
Breitenfeldt <sup>47)</sup>, J. W. Mellor <sup>48)</sup>, Brown and
Norton <sup>49)</sup> and C. W. Parmelee <sup>50)</sup>.

All these investigations have contributed to a better knowledge and
understanding of Chinese reds made through reduction of copper oxide.
This offers the present artists a lead in their experiments but it is
hardly imaginable that they will reach a higher level than the Chinese
potters of the Sung dynasty. An example of copper red glaze can be seen
on photograph 7:

5\. GOLD.

**The noble red.**

Gold is often called the oldest known metal which was and still is used
to express a particular richness and also as a standard of value.
Specimens are found which could be dated from ancient human
civilizations. The occurrence of the metal in pure form and the easy way
of manufacture made it possible that it became one of the oldest known
and applied metals.

In the 2<sup>nd</sup> millennium BC gold started to compete with copper
and silver as a standard of value. The first coins from gold and
gold-alloys are known from the seventh century BC but remain rare. This
scarceness applied specifically to the European countries (Roman
Imperium) as there were no gold mines in the European area. The oldest
known golden Roman coin, called Aureus, was first made around 217 BC and
bears the portrait of the God Janus. This belated use was in contrast
with the more eastern area where the use of gold had already a longer
existing tradition as metal as such but also in glass.

Gold is another possibility to create red colours when brought into
molten glasses. Its application in conjunction with glass is old just as
well. The specific application of gold for the preparation of rubin-red
glass has also a long existing history. Clay tablets from the time of
Assurbanipal (668 – 626 BC) give already descriptions for the use of
gold for the preparation of gold-rubin glass <sup>51)</sup>. The
transliterations of R. Campbell Thomson have in that respect very much
contributed to give a better picture of the existing developments at
that time.

A famous example of gold-rubin glass and at the same time evidence of
the high level of the art of glass manufacturing during the Roman
civilization, is the so-called Lycurgus bowl. It is dated as from AD 300
and shows the legendary king Lycurgus from Thracia who is completely and
fatally entangled by vine-tendrils. A general explanation for this
representation is that Dionysus had turned the nymph Ambrosia into a
vine-tendril after she was assaulted by Lycurgus. It is peculiar that
the colour of the bowl is changing from olive-green to deep rubin-red,
dependent of the amount of light which is fallen onto it (photograph 8).
Analyses of a shiver showed that the glass contains gold in a quantity
of 3 till 5 ‰. This game of colours, changing with the amount of light,
did presume that it was a magic bowl which could change water into wine.
Now, almost 2000 years later, the Lycurgus bowl is the subject of
studies about nanotechnology.

After a peak in glass manufacturing high standards were reached e.g. in
Egypt, Mesopotamia and in Syria (from where the invention of the
glass-workers blow-pipe is originated, 1<sup>st</sup> century BC), there
followed a period of decline of roughly 1000 years. Glass manufacturing
experienced a certain revival starting roughly in the 10<sup>th</sup>
century. The powerful position of the church, particularly some
monasteries, has without doubt contributed with regard to these
developments.

Lycurgus bowl

The monasteries, especially some Benedictine ones, could be seen as the
defenders of the antique heritage and the guards of the transmitted
literature, including those about glass manufacturing. In this respect
the books in question from the bishop of Sevilla (7<sup>th</sup>
century) and the bishop of Mainz (Hrabanus Maurus ‘De universo’, abt.
845) are dated back to Pliny, one of the main
‘technical-encyclopaedists’ of the ancient world.

The ‘Codex Luccencis’ (abt. 800) was based on Byzantine experiences.
Another well known compilation of recipes from the 10<sup>th</sup>
century was mainly based on this codex and is known as ‘Mappas
Clavicula’.

The recipe-collections of Heraclius, based on these two books, consist
of three books. The first two books are dated as from the
10<sup>th</sup> century while the third book is dated from the
12<sup>th</sup>-13<sup>th</sup> century.

One of the more important books in many respects is the book of the
Presbyterian priest Theophilus and is called: ‘Schedula diversarum
artium’ and is dated from the 10<sup>th</sup> century. In this book the
priest describes the than existing methods for all kinds of crafts,
including e.g. how to produce leaded windows.

With the start of the Renaissance there appeared several compilations
describing again the gold rubin colours of which the ‘Secreti per
colori’ stems from the beginning of the 15<sup>th</sup> century. It
mentions the following recipe:

‘Take 3 parts of the white material (is lead-crystal glass), 1 part of
Goldchalk, 1 part of Brasilash and 3 parts of fine rock salt. These
ingredients must be mixed properly in the described ratio and put into a
kiln. After four or six hours one must take it out and one shall have
red coloured glass’.

The Goldchalk was prepared through a solution of gold in aqua regia.

Another important book was published in 1612 and was written by the
Florentine priest Antonio Neri and called ‘L’arte vetraria’. The book of
Neri gives more or less a status about the situation of the art of glass
manufacturing in the Renaissance. Neri mentions also raw materials such
like lime and also lead containing materials. As commonly accepted, he
was ahead of his time as with these recipes he already indicated the
invention later on of the Bohemian lime-glass and the English
lead-glass. His compilation was translated into the English language by
the doctor Christopher Merret in 1662. In 1674 Ravenscroft required his
patent for the lead crystal glass. The publication of Neri covered most
of the experiences and recipes known at that moment. His book was
published in several Italian editions, an English-one in 1662, two
Latin-ones in 1668 and 1686 resp., while Kunckel made a German
translation in 1679.

An important development in respect of gold-based ruby red colours was
made through the Purple of Cassius. Andreas Cassius graduated in 1632 in
London and lived later on as a doctor in Hamburg. His son was the first
who published the discoveries of his father (‘De Auro’, Hamburg, 1685).

According to this publication the preparation was the following:

‘English tin, the purer the better, must be solved in aqua regia until a
yellowish or red wine-like solution appears. This solution must be kept
for some days in order to give the gases the possibility to escape. Next
to this one must prepare a solution of gold in aqua regia “in the normal
way”. After this one must take a large glassy container with a wide
opening and put water into it. One must add somewhat of the tin
solution, directly followed by an addition of a same quantity of the
gold solution. One shall than remark a gold precipitation which will,
under influence of the air, turn into a beautiful purple coloured
powder’.

This invention is still the basis for the gold-rubin decoration colours.
The variation in this type of colour is from soft clear rose till dark
plum pink but all have in common that they are based on gold colours
made through the Purple of Cassius concept. More details regarding these
onglaze and inglaze decoration colours follow later.

From great influence on the further development were the investigations
of J. Kunckel. Kunckel, a German chemist, was not a compiler but he
investigated the existing theories of his time. He worked as a chemist
and as a pharmacist for the German elector Johann Georg II. Friedrich
Wilhelm von Brandenburg leased him the ‘Christallinen-Glashütte zu
Drewitz’, a glass factory in Berlin. At this factory he investigated the
recipes as given by Neri. Among these recipes are those for the
preparation of gold-rubin red glass. Neither Kunckel, Neri nor
Ravenscroft were inventor of this red rubin glass. However, the
publications of Kunckel were very important in respect of sieving the
then existing information. His work at the Berlin glass manufacturing
became of great importance for the further development of rubin red
glass, above all that he distinguished the property of the final colour
development after reheating of the, in first instance, colourless glass.

During the 18<sup>th</sup> century however the rubin red glass and the
making of it became less popular. The demand disappeared and with that
the knowledge and the experience how to produce it. In 1834 it was
necessary to hold a contest ‘how to prepare rubin red glass in the most
economical way’. This was done by “Der Verein Zur Förderung des
Gewerbefleisses in Preussen”. From the result of this contest it became
clear that it was not an absolute precondition to start from Purple of
Cassius, but that metallic gold or any gold solution could do the job.

From the above it may be clear that gold was and still is used to
prepare gold rubin red glass. For red glazes gold is not a way for
manufacturing but besides the typical nice and bright rubin red gold
colour in (crystal) glass there is also a gold application for red
colours in ceramics. The application meant here in particular is the one
of decoration colours e.g. for porcelain. For a traditional onglaze
decoration firing for porcelain one applied since long time abt. 780 °C
to 820 °C in a cycle of several hours (traditional cycle). After the
invention of the Purple of Cassius, one succeeded in making onglaze
decoration colours based on gold, creating the typical red colours. This
happened especially after the invention of how to make porcelain
(Böttger). By varying the amount of the Purple of Cassius and the
addition of other components one succeeded in making a range of gold
colours ranging from light rose till dark plum red. Until today, some
well known manufacturers of decoration colours like Johnson Matthey,
Ferro and also manufacturers of Japan, Taiwan and China are offering
these gold colours which are applied in the manufacturing of decals or
by direct application. The manufacturing principle is still the same
although the processing differs between the manufacturers.

Gold colours are manufactured in light pinks (rose shades), mid-colours
(fuchsia shades) till dark red (plum) colours. The light colours have a
gold-base part of roughly 2 till 4 parts, the mid-colours between 7 till
10 parts and the dark red colours even up to 20 parts. A gold base
exists normally of a gold component (e.g. gold chloride), stannous
chloride, stannic chloride, potassium aluminium compound and an ammonium
compound. Besides the gold base the compositions of the final colours
exists also of suitable fluxes, in most cases two to achieve a good and
wide firing range and to obtain the necessary chemical resistance.

Kenneth Shaw <sup>52)</sup> mentions the following flux composition for
use with gold colours:

>  Na<sub>2</sub>O 10.29 %

>  K<sub>2</sub>O 3.64

>  PbO 20.54

>  B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 23.28

>  SiO<sub>2</sub> 42.25

>  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

>  100.00 %

> 

> Other suitable fluxes can be compositions like:

> 

>  Na<sub>2</sub>O 14.02 % and/or Li<sub>2</sub>O 1.35 %

>  PbO 33.47 Na<sub>2</sub>O 3.92

>  Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 5.01 K<sub>2</sub>O 2.98

>  B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 5.28 PbO 29.69

>  SiO<sub>2</sub> 42.22 CdO 3.01

>  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 2.76

>  100.00 % B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 7.80

>  SiO<sub>2</sub> 47.51

>  ZrO<sub>2</sub> 0.98

>  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

>  100.00 %

One way for the production of these gold pink colours is that the
powders of gold base and fluxes are sintered followed by milling to the
application fineness. Fineness of these type of colours is e.g. (PSD
curve) D<sub>10 </sub>= 0.4µ; D<sub>50</sub> = 2.8µ and D<sub>90 </sub>=
10.9µ. Application of the colours is done manually (painting) or by
method of screen print transfer. The numerous examples of red, lilac and
dark red floral decors (mainly roses) started already in the early times
of European porcelain production and continued till these times. UK had
always a strong reputation for these types of floral designs as well as
the famous German porcelain factories. The transfers with these gold
pinks have always been very popular in the UK but also in East European
countries like Russia and Ukraine where huge amounts of porcelain are
used by tradition. Examples of some gold pinks are shown in photographs
9 and 10.

From the above it may be clear that only gold onglaze decoration colours
are developing the nice pink red colours but that no glazes can be made
in a similar way.

Without doubt one can state that during the last 10 – 15 years the
(gold) decoration decreased dramatically in the European countries. The
closing down of many porcelain factories in (Western) European countries
and outsourcing production to Asian and other countries have a dramatic
effect on screen-print transfer manufacturers particularly in Western
Europe as well as decoration departments of porcelain factories. Now, it
is very rare to see the rich and exuberant floral designs on porcelain
which were a tradition in many households only some decades back.

6\. CHROMIUM TIN STAINS

Red shades through calcination

> 

> A completely different way to obtain reddish colours in ceramics is
> making use of calcined stains e.g. of the chromium tin calcium based
> type. Besides this rather big family of stains there are also other
> possibilities to obtain lighter, more rose colour tones like MnAl
> stains and CrAl stains. Lilac colour stains are normally based on Sn
> and Cr with a small amount of cobalt to turn the lilac more into the
> bluish shade. The bigger family of CrSnCa stains has different members
> but most of them have a maroon, crimson, wine-red or cherry-red like
> appearance with light and darker members and with reddish or more
> blue-reddish family members. The final colour depends e.g. on the

> stains.

For calcination of a given stain one makes a choice for the most
suitable raw materials. Purity and fineness are some of the parameters
which are important in this respect <sup>53)</sup>. The raw materials
are weight into the right proportion for that particular stain followed
by mixing. This mixed raw material batch of a given colour stain is than
put into refractory saggers followed by a firing process which is
typical for that particular stain. After firing the colour stain is
milled to the right fineness, if necessary washed, dried, sieved and
packed. This is only a general way to produce a standard basic stain. As
every new production firing of a new batch may cause some small
deviations from standard, the final colour stain is in most cases build
up by a high percentage of the basic stain and some materials which give
the possibility to correct the small deviations from batch to batch
production of the basic stain. In this way, the final colour as supplied
to the customers is always brought up and corrected to the standard
colour values. Making colourstains is a rather specialized job and very
much based on empirical know-how and the above mentioned way is only a
general way for manufacturing. Many stains have their special
parameters, production process, their special mineralisers to be added,
etc. Much of this know-how stays within the manufacturing companies and
the specialists involved. Compared to some 50 years ago and given the
scaling up and concentrating of volumes at only some limited locations
resulting in less production types, the number of experienced people for
the manufacturing of colourstains has decreased over time. One can state
that the major producers of ceramic stains concentrate on high volume –
high profitable products and they avoid making small volume stains which
in a way is a reduction of the total available ceramic colour pallet.
Compared to roughly some 50 to 60 years ago some very interesting
ceramic pigments are not available anymore as economical reasons, health
issues (hexa valent chromium), relocation and concentration of
production sites have stopped production of those (smaller volume)
stains. One of the examples meant here is e.g. the so-called
Manganese-Rose colour stain. One of the production processes was as
follows <sup>54)</sup>:

\- 3 kg of manganese nitrate was dissolved in water and mixed with 0.9
kg in

water dissolved ammonium phosphate

\- the precipitate was dissolved in 1 ltr nitric acid and mixed with 1
kg

aluminium hydroxide

\- this mass was dried and calcined at 1140 °C -1160 °C.

\- after the calcination the stain was milled, washed and again calcined
at

1280 °C.

The resulting rose pink stain was, after bringing to the right fineness
of course, used as under glaze colour, as colourstain for glazes and as
body stain. Given the very special way of preparation and health aspects
of today it is no wonder that these special stains are no longer
produced. MnAl colour stains are still available on the market but made
according to a complete dry process.

Another example is the production of Aluminium Rose, a CrAl stain:

\- 48 kg of aluminium hydroxide and 45 kg of zinc oxide was mixed.

\- added to this mix was 6 kg potassium dichromate dissolved in water
and

well mixed together

\- this mixture was than dried and calcined at 1300 °C – 1400 °C.

\- after calcination the product was milled and washed and then dried.

Also this type of flamingo rose pink colour stain is not produced in
this way anymore.

A very nice flamingo rose pink has been made as follows:

\- 41.16 % of tin oxide

\- 27.44 % of calcium carbonate

\- 22.52 % of fine quarts

\- 8.65 % of lead oxide

\- 0.23 % of potassium dichromate

Mixing and calcining at 1250 °C followed by wet milling and washing,
drying and sieving. The result is a nice and clear flamingo rose. Also
this stain is not produced anymore for economical and health reasons.

The possibilities for the still widely used wine-red CrSn stains which
are worthwhile to mention here are based on the calcination of calcium
carbonate, tin oxide, quartz and (green) chromium oxide.

> In former days one used to make first a calcium stannate out of
> calcium carbonate and tin oxide in the ratio 40 : 60. This mixture was
> wet-milled and calcined at 1150 °C. This calcination product was than
> wet-milled together with quartz, tin oxide and a chromate, dried and
> calcined at 1280 °C. This calcined product was wet milled to the right
> fineness, washed till all soluble chromate salts were removed and then
> dried. An example is following receipt:

> 

>  calcium carbonate 23.34 %

> ** **tin oxide 15.56

> ** ----**-----------------------------------

> ** **quartz 38.89

> ** **tin oxide 19.40

>  lead chromate 2.80

>  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

>  100.00 %

> 

Also following cherry-red lead containing pink was produced in the past
by dry mixing the raw materials, calcining, washing and drying:

>  calcium carbonate 25.70 %

>  quartz 22.48

>  tin oxide 42.60

>  potassium dichromate 0.72

>  red lead oxide 8.50

>  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

>  100.00 %

> 

Such formulations, having a small percentage of lead (introduced e.g. as
lead chromate PbCrO<sub>4,</sub> lead carbonate PbCO<sub>3</sub> or as
red lead oxide) show normally a somewhat more bright and clear (wine)
red colour compared to lead free compositions.

As the toxicity of lead compounds and also the lead release following
DIN EN 1388 became more and more important, the ceramic industry uses
now unleaded stains by preference. In this respect one has also looked
for replacements of the lead addition while keeping the good properties
caused by the lead addition. An example for such a development is given
in US patent 4358321 published in 1982 <sup>55)</sup>. The invention
describes the application of bismuth and / or phosphate compounds
instead of lead compounds resulting in an intense red colour.
Compositions mentioned are:

tin oxide 40.08 % 40.66 %

calcium carbonate 31.01 31.47

silica 24.05 24.40

chromium oxide 1.25 1.07

>  -----------------------------------------------------------

>  potassium nitrate 1.77 ----

>  potassium carbonate ---- 1.80

>  bismuth oxide 1.84 ----

>  bismuth nitrate ---- 0.60

>  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

>  100.00 % 100.00 %

> 

Following the patent, the materials were wet-mixed and finely ground,
the potassium and the bismuth compounds added, mixed and calcined at
1340 °C for 1 hour, wet-ground and washed and then dried.

Today, only the dry process is utilized by dry mixing calcium carbonate,
tin oxide, quartz and chromium oxide. For a better dispersion of the
chromium oxide, a pre-mix is often made of chromium oxide and quartz
with an intensive mixer. The dry mixed batch is than calcined and the
pigment is than dry milled to the right fineness. Special materials
acting as a catalyst can be added to achieve darker colours.

Lilac colour stains are composed out of tin oxide and a chromium
compound, in most cases potassium dichromate
K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> now replaced by chromium oxide.
Materials as cerium oxide, boric acid and lithium carbonate are added
following the development of that particular stain. Some examples are:

>  *Dark red lilac* *Bluish lilac*

>  tin oxide 91.45 % 75.35 %

>  potassium dichromate 3.45 0.65

>  cerium oxide 3.75 ---

>  lithium carbonate 1.35 ---

>  boric acid --- 22.35

>  cobalt oxide --- 1.65

>  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

>  100.00 % 100.00 %

> 

>  calcination temperature: 1290 °C 1210 °C

> 

After calcination the stains must be wet-milled to the right fineness,
washed and dried. The cobalt oxide is added to turn the lilac colour
into a more bluish colour tone (lavender).

With all these examples, however, it is possible to create beautiful
wine red, crimson, maroon or cherry-red colours but no clear red colours
as possible with CdSe stains or glazes. People with some experience in
colour ceramics know that the composition of the glaze is also important
for the proper development of CrSn colour shades. Small additions of tin
oxide in the glaze formulae help to stabilize the colour. Magnesium must
be out of the compositions. No reductions must take place during the
glostfiring otherwise the famous white spots will appear in the coloured
glaze.

A typical lead containing glaze which shows a good development for CrSn
stains is based on following frit:

> 

>  Na<sub>2</sub>O 0.145 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.172
> SiO<sub>2</sub> 2.977

K<sub>2</sub>O 0.050 B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.222

>  CaO 0.266

>  PbO 0.539

> 

The milling formula for the glaze is 90 parts of the frit together with
10 parts of kaolin. This glaze has a maturing firing range of 1020 °C
till 1100 °C and shows normally no lead release after standard DIN EN
1388-1 / -2. Despite this, many of this type of glazes have been
replaced by unleaded glazes like glazes based on strontium containing
frits <sup>56)</sup> like e.g.:

> 

>  Li<sub>2</sub>O 0.062 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.134
> SiO<sub>2</sub> 2.302

>  K<sub>2</sub>O 0.039

>  CaO 0.357

>  BaO 0.107

>  SrO 0.435

> 

Milling formula of the glaze is 90 parts of frit together with 10 parts
of kaolin. Glazes as these are nowadays widely used as unleaded
transparent glazes, also as base glaze for CrSn wine red glazes.

As mentioned, the calcination process gives some different possibilities
to obtain reddish colours. However, also in this case none of them can
compete or even come close to the clear and bright red colour having a
dominate wavelength of about 614 nm. Photograph 11 shows an example of a
CrSn coloured ceramic vase.

7\. NICKEL

A purplish red.

> 

> Nickel was discovered by the Swedish chemist Axel Frederik Cronstedt
> back in 1751 from niccolite (NiAs) see figure 7. He tried to isolate
> copper from the mineral but to his surprise at the end he had a
> silver-like powder what he called nickel. The name comes from the
> German ‘Kupfernickel’: German miners could not derive any copper from
> the ore and believed that a sprite from the German mythology named
> ‘Nickel’ did the copper disappear and put the other material instead.
> The nickel ore was at those times often confused with copper ore. As
> from 1881 nickel was used for coins and later on it has found many
> applications in the metallurgy. Most of the nickel today comes from
> pentlandite (NiS.2FeS), from garnirite or limonite. The main areas
> producing nickel are in Ontario / Canada, at Norilsk / Russia, at
> Cuba, Australia and Indonesia.

> 

> Nickel has been used for long time already although people at those
> times did not realise that it was the element nickel as we know it
> today. In the area of what we now know as Syria various metal objects
> have been found which contain nickel. The oldest known use of nickel
> goes back till 3500 BC. Also from old Chinese documents appears that
> nickel-containing minerals as niccolite were already used to give a
> green colour to glass.

> 

> In ceramics nickel is often used as nickel oxide (NiO) as such and as
> raw material for the production of calcined stains like a black stain
> (Cr-Fe-Ni or Cr-Fe-Ni-Co), a grey stain (Co-Ni-Si) or brown stains
> (Fe-Cr-Ni). When used as raw material for the production of a ceramic
> stain it ends up in a certain structure (periclase or spinel) and has
> in such cases normally a stable character. When nickel oxide is used
> as such as direct colouring compound in glazes, the effect is often
> unpredictable and unstable.

> Greenish, grayish and brownish colours may be obtained depending on
> the glaze components and firing conditions. Especially when it comes
> to reddish colours the necessarily compositions are quite narrow and
> it is only possible to obtain rather stable violet-like colours in a
> matt glaze composition. No comparison with red colours which can be
> obtained through chromium oxide or salts, uranium compounds or cadmium
> selenium stains or glazes.

> 

> As a general glaze composition to obtain these violet red nickel
> coloured glazes counts:

> 

> Li<sub>2</sub>O, Na<sub>2</sub>O, K<sub>2</sub>O 0.00-0.15
> Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.08 – 0.35 SiO<sub>2</sub> 0.8-2.1

> BaO 0.35-0.50

> PbO 0.00-0.10

> ZnO 0.40-0.50

In 1921 an investigation was published <sup>57)</sup> describing the
colouring effects of nickel oxide resulting in green, blue,
violet-purple and brown colours. The best compositions for
violet-purple-red colours were:

> 

>  BaO 0.50 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.35 SiO<sub>2</sub> 2.10

>  ZnO 0.50

>   + NiO 0.025

and: K<sub>2</sub>O 0.15 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.35
SiO<sub>2</sub> 2.10

>  BaO 0.45

>  ZnO 0.40  + NiO 0.025

> 

Lehnhäuser <sup>58)</sup> gives similar recipes for purple-violet glazes
and mentions following composition for a temperature of 1100 °C till
1140 °C:

> 

>  Na<sub>2</sub>O 0.05 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.12 SiO<sub>2</sub>
> 1.20

>  BaO 0.20

>  PbO 0.15  + 1% NiCO<sub>3</sub>: lilac

>  ZnO 0.60  + 2% NiCO<sub>3</sub>: violet-red

> 

In most of the compositions mentioned an amount of 0.10 to 0.15 of NiO
in the Seger formula is present. The presence of BaO and ZnO is
necessary for a good violet-red colour but the end result is a glaze
with a matt finish for temperatures of 1100 °C or higher. A way to
decrease the firing temperature and remaining the violet-red colour is
to add a low smelting flux. The best result in that case is obtained by
adding 10 to 20% of a simple lead mono silicate which makes it possible
to decrease the firing temperature to1040 °C.

In 1964 an investigation was published by Franz Kure <sup>59)</sup>
describing possibilities for red coloured glazes. Basically, he
mentioned similar compositions as described above with the remark that
compositions for red-violet colour tones have narrow possibilities and
are sensitive for temperature differences.

For the possibilities with nickel he mentioned that:

\- a low amount of alkali is necessary for the flow properties of the
glaze

\- too high an amount of Li<sub>2</sub>O turns the colour to blue

\- a certain amount of BaO and ZnO must be present for a red-violet
colour

\- the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> content is not that important for the
red-violet colour but more

for the reactivity of the glaze

\- too much CaO turns the colour into violet-blue

\- (too much) PbO turns the colour into brownish

\- also a too high amount of NiO makes the glaze too refractory and too

brownish

An example for this type of violet-purple red coloured nickel glaze is
shown by photograph 12. The following glaze composition was used to
obtain this result at a firing temperature of 1040 °C – 1060 °C:

>  (Ferro) frit 32570 36.00 % (BaO frit)

>  (Ferro) frit 35200 54.50 (Pb0 – ZnO frit)

>  Kaolin 8.00

>  Nickel oxide 1.50

>  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

>  100.00 %

Firing of this glaze was done at 1060 °C in an electrical fired kiln in
a traditional cycle. The glaze surface has a matt finish and is rather
stable between 1020 °C and 1080 °C.

8\. CHROMIUM

Red results with a multi-colouring component

> 

> The element chromium was in fact discovered when Johann Gottlob
> Lehmann found an orange-red mineral in the Beryozovskoye mines in the
> Ural Mountains in 1761. He called this mineral ‘Siberian red lead’
> because he thought that it was a lead compound with selenium and iron.
> Later on, it appeared that he had found the mineral Crocoite which
> exists as leadchromate (PbCrO<sub>4</sub>). See also photograph 13.

>  Mineral Crocoite (PbCrO<sub>4</sub>)

> 

> A few years later Peter Simon Pallas visited the same location again
> and discovered that this ‘Siberian red lead’ was very suitable as
> pigment for paints. The good resistance properties of paints with lead
> chromate made the application afterwards very common and some examples
> of the warm and signaling yellow colour are very well known as i.e.
> the colour of the school busses in the USA and the house colour of
> Deutsche Post. In more recent times, the lead chromate based paints
> and colours have been substituted more and more by organic and lead
> free compounds due to environmental and safety concerns.

> 

> It was the French chemist Nicolas-Louis Vanquilin who in 1797
> succeeded in isolating chromium oxide out of Crocoite by mixing the
> mineral with chloric acid. A year later he succeeded in making the
> metal chromium out of the chromium oxide by heating the material in a
> kiln. During the 19<sup>th</sup> century chromium became more and more
> important as metal in alloys to increase the properties of the alloys.

> Very remarkable in this respect is that the application of chromium
> metal to increase the quality of metal alloy properties has already
> been applied by the Chinese. The tips of swords and crossbows as found
> in burial pits dating from the late 3<sup>rd</sup> century BC - Qin
> dynasty of the famous Terracotta army near Xi’an have been analysed by
> archaeologists. The ancient bronze tips showed no sign of corrosion
> due to the fact that the tips were coated with chromium
> <sup>60)</sup>.

> 

> The most important source for chromium is the mineral chromite
> (FeCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) which is mainly found in South Africa,
> Kazachstan, Russia, India and Turkey. In 2000 an amount of 15 million
> tons have been mined which give about 4 million tons of the metal
> chromium.

> 

> The name chromium comes from the Greek word ‘chroma’ which means
> colour. For everyone involved in chemistry this may be clear given the
> numerous and different coloured compounds which are able to create
> with chromium. Also for people in ceramics it is clear. Chromium
> compounds and stains are a base for very different colours as green
> (chromium oxide; chromium silicate; chromium aluminium silicate),
> yellow (lead chromate), pink colours in chromium tin stains and, of
> course, chromium red glazes.

> 

> Chromium red glazes have been studied and developed from the early
> beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Some important studies and

because one is walking onto the relief of the tile itself (see also
photograph 14).

The glaze can be dry mixed with an intensive mixer, mixed with water and
sprayed onto the biscuit fired surface. Firing temperature is 940 °C.

All these type of glazes have been developed and applied during the
first half of the last century and partly till the 60ties and the
70ties. Although beautiful red glazes can be achieved, the negative
aspects of these types of glazes became more and more important. Of
course, the health aspect of using chromates and bi-chromates, the
carcinogenic properties of Cr-VI, the necessary application of lead
alumina silicates or just simple lead silicates, the vaporization of
chromium compounds during the firing which can result in unwanted
colour-effects and the very low chemical resistance which made these
type of glazes only applicable for ceramic art- and giftware. With the
industrial introduction and increasing possibilities of cadmium selenium
glazes as from the mid of last century, the chromium red glazes
disappeared and are now only applied in some rare cases by artists or
some smaller potters.

9\. URANIUM

The radioactive red

The history of uranium based red glazes is as a matter of fact of course
a young but also a rather short one. Young because it developed only
after the discovery of the element uranium and after the different
oxides were put into operation. Short because one distinguished on one
hand also the negative and dangerous properties with regard to radiation
phenomena when people are exposed to these components and on the other
hand governments also blocked the various applications, this in favour
of the application for the investigations in the atomic energy area.

Uranium is called after Uranus, in the Greek mythology the father of the
goddess Aphrodite. The name for the element was chosen because of the
planet which was discovered some years before by the Englishman W.
Herschel in 1781.

The German chemist and mineralogist Martin Heinrich Klaproth (1743 –
1817) must be honoured as the discoverer of the new element. He was
first a pharmacist and a chemistry master before he became a professor
at the University of Berlin. He did much work on the analyses of rocks.
As a result of this he found several new elements such as uranium but
also zirconium (1789), titanium (1795) and cerium (1803). He also
discovered strontium as well and studied tellurium. By that time one
called the component as representative in pitchblende uranium, while
later on it became clear that it was the oxide form
U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub> which was present in pitchblende or uranite.

Although the official discovery of the element took place on the eve of
imposing developments in both physics and chemistry, one had already
found some pieces of yellow coloured glass containing about 1% of
uranium near Naples. These pieces could be dated as from AD
79.<sup>68)</sup>

The developments with respect to uranium went very fast after the
discovery of its radiation properties. Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen, a German
physicist, did an investigation during 1895 about the penetration of
cathode-beams when he did his great discovery of the special radiation
which is called after him. He proved that such radiation had other
properties than the cathode-beams.

The French physicist Henri Bequerel studied this important phenomenon
and investigated the possibility of a relation between the origin of the
X-rays and fluorescence phenomenae. During this investigation he
discovered the radiation of uranium salts. As the successor of his
father and grandfather in the position of professor in the Muséum
d’histoire naturelle (Paris), he studied the radiation of uranium in a
magnetic field, generated by an electromagnet. This studies resulted in
the appointment that the radiation was a property of the uranium atom
and valid for all the uranium components.

Maria Curie Sklodowska continued in this field and discovered that
uranium was not the only element showing radiation properties. Together
with her husband and well known French physicist Pierre Curie she
established that the radiation was not an exclusive property of uranium
and that also thorium showed this radiation. During further
investigations of minerals they found that pitchblende showed a much
stronger radiation than the quantities of uranium or thorium did
presume. This led to the discovery of polonium and finally to radium in
1898. <sup>69)</sup>

The importance of these new materials was soon distinguished. The main
mineral and source for uranium was and still is pitchblende, also called
uranite: U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>. Uranium occurs however also in much
other minerals such like carnotite (an uranium potassium vanadate), in
autunite (a calcium uranyl-phosphate), in uranophane (a hydrated uranium
calcium silicate), in curite (a hydrated lead urinate), in torbernite (a
hydrated copper uranyl phosphate and many others. <sup>70)</sup>

Intensive searching programmes showed that the element is not as rare as
it was once thought. Because of its importance in the field of the
atomic energy one has searched very intensively to uranium containing
minerals. Some main and well known uranium deposits are at Sjinkolobwe
(Zaire), Jáchymov (Czech Rep.), Cornwall (England), Colorado (USA), near
Great Bear Lake and Athabasca Lake (Canada), Witwatersrand (South
Africa), Rum Jungle and Isa Mount (Australia), Bihar (India) and Poços
de Caldas (Brasil). <sup>71)</sup>

All these deposits are mainly explored with regard to the economical
value of uranium. One of the most important applications is its use in
electrical power plants. It may be clear that this application is out of
the scope of this publication. The point however where these two items
do come together again is at the developments which mention the use of a
glass in a unit for the melting-in of nuclear waste material.<sup>72,
73)</sup>

Other than some early findings of uranium containing glass through which
an early application is known, a deliberated use of uranium containing
minerals was uncommonly limited. The application of several uranium
salts in the glass <sup>74)</sup> and ceramic industry came slightly
into fashion during the first half of the 20st century. There are
however not so many publications available as far as the ceramic sphere
is concerned. An article of Charles F. Binns and Frobisher Lyttl
<sup>75)</sup> published in 1920 mention some compositions for uranium
red glazes. As uranium source they mentioned sodium urinate
(Na<sub>2</sub>U<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>). The glazes, with 20 and 37 %
Na<sub>2</sub>U<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> resp., developed a bright
cinnabar red at a temperature of SK 04a (1020 °C). The base glaze was a
lead alumina silicate with only an introduction of some potassium and
zinc oxide in the R<sub>2</sub>O / RO group.

Another article was published by Zimmermann <sup>76)</sup>. He started
with a simple lead-alumina-silicate with the following composition:

> 

>  PbO 1.000 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.175 SiO<sub>2</sub> 0.850

> 

As a recommendation he indicated that the SiO<sub>2</sub> content may
not exceed an amount of 1.0 according to the Seger formula. The
influence of different compounds in the R<sub>2</sub>O / RO group was
also studied. For these trials he used 20 parts of
Na<sub>2</sub>U<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> to 100 parts of glaze.

Arnulf Holl <sup>77)</sup> studied also the rule of the body composition
and found the negative influence of high calcium containing bodies with
regard to the development of the red colour. A notable fact to be
recorded is that he used an amount of 18 to 21 % of uranium nitrate as
colouring compound. Other authors, among them the German Hans Eska,
warned against the use of this soluble uranium salt. The preparation of
the glaze with this soluble component and the handling of the glazed
articles by hand are reasons that a direct contact with this toxic
element and the skin is almost unavoidable. The negative influence of
calcium oxide on the red colour is in contradiction with the results of
other investigators.

One of the most comprehensive and detailed studies was published in 1933
by Hans Eska <sup>78)</sup>. In this publication called ‘Wetterfeste
uranrote Glasuren’ (‘Weather resistant uranium red glazes’) he described
the best possible glaze compositions to obtain resistant red uranium
glazes. He mentioned the application of uranium nitrate, as soluble
salt, very injudicious. He also turned down the argument that this
particular uranium source should be cheaper. In his investigation he
indicated the influences of modifications in the R<sub>2</sub>O / RO,
R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and RO<sub>2</sub> groups on the colour,
gloss, craze resistance and weather resistance.

As a base glaze composition he used a fritted lead meta silicate,
completed with components as BaO, ZnO, CaF<sub>2</sub>, MgO,
Na<sub>2</sub>O (as sodium urinate), K<sub>2</sub>O and
B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> also fritted, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and
UO<sub>3</sub> as uranium oxide U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>.

The trials were fired in a brown coal fired muffelkiln at SK 08a (940
°C) and SK 05a (1000 °C). Heating up took 26 hours and the cooling 50
hours.

One of the tests applied after the firing was a test with hydrochloric
acid. The results were classified in 7 groups ranging from ‘not
attacked’ to ‘completely affected’. Glazes with only a variation in the
SiO<sub>2</sub> content according to the formula:

PbO 1.00 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.10 SiO<sub>2</sub> 0.80 – 1.60

UO<sub>3</sub> 0.20<sub> </sub>

> 

showed an improved resistance with an increasing SiO<sub>2</sub>
content. The colour of these glazes was red.

If part of the lead content was replaced by barium oxide (0.1 mol and
0.2 mol resp.) the colour changed more towards orange-red colour tones.
While the surface became more matt, craze resistance worsened, but the
weather resistance should improve.

The introduction of ZnO (0.1 mol and 0.2 mol resp.) resulted in more
bright red glazes and even more bright with an increasing
SiO<sub>2</sub> content. As best composition is mentioned 0.1 mol ZnO in
combination with 1.4 mol SiO<sub>2</sub>. Those glazes showed a high
gloss but the resistance was bad.

CaO was applied and introduced as CaF<sub>2</sub> because this
Ca-compound showed the best results if several Ca containing materials
were compared. The calcium fluoride had a positive effect on the red
colour development and also on the weather resistance.

A partly replacement of lead by magnesium oxide resulted also in red
colours but the properties with regard to craze- and weather resistance
worsened.

A partly replacement of lead by potassium resulted in more crazing while
it also became more difficult to obtain a reasonable weather resistance.
The red colour developed well but in the red appeared yellow spots.

Sodium had in common with potassium that it had a negative influence on
the red colour development especially at higher temperatures. A good red
colour however was obtained with a Na<sub>2</sub>O content of 0.05 mol
with at the same time a SiO<sub>2</sub> content of not lower as 1.20
mol. An increased Na<sub>2</sub>O content till 0.10 mol required a
SiO<sub>2</sub> content 1.20 mol or preferably somewhat lower. The
sodium-lead uranium glazes had a strong disposition to crazing and good
weather resistant glazes were not obtained.

In summary it was concluded that good resistant uranium red glazes could
be obtained with compositions between:

> 

> PbO 0.85 – 0.90 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.10 SiO<sub>2</sub> 1.20
> – 1.60

> BaO ┐ UO<sub>3</sub> 0.15

> CaF<sub>2</sub> ├ 0.15 - 0.10

> K<sub>2</sub>O ┘

> 

The influence of metal oxides such as CuO, CoO,
Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and
Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> on the colour development was also
ascertained. The main conclusion was that these oxides destroyed the
original uranium orange or red colour, but that sometimes colour effects
were created which were impossible to obtain with more conventional (and
cheaper) stains.

Another interesting but also rather compendious article was published in
1934 by Karl Kautz <sup>79)</sup>. He used
Na<sub>2</sub>O.2UO<sub>3</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O as colorant and studied
the influence of glaze components on the development of specific
colours. As a result he mentioned for a variety of colours the best
possible glaze compositions. A ‘pleasing red glaze of this type with a
crystalline structure’ could be obtained with the following glaze
composition:

> 

>  Na<sub>2</sub>O 0.10 UO<sub>3</sub> 0.20 SiO<sub>2</sub> 2.00

>  PbO 0.90

> 

The remark that this glaze was only used to produce ‘a few small pieces
of art ware’ is significant in respect of the stability and
reproducibility of this red coloured glaze.

Franz Eggert <sup>80)</sup> published an article in 1951 about the
affecting of the tomato-red uranium glazes. His base glaze was a lead
alumina silicate in combination with black UO<sub>3</sub> as colouring
component, this to avoid the simultaneously introduction of sodium.<sub>
</sub>He concluded among other things that in general all the glazes
showed as a matter of fact different coloured layers. A first layer with
a notable influence of the body; a middle layer and the top layer which
was in most cases responsible for the final colour tone. Some remarks
out of this publication are worthwhile to mention in respect of the
realization of red colours.

An addition of 10 % of zinc oxide resulted in a colour shift towards
more blood red.

5 % of lithium carbonate resulted in a dark-brown coloured first layer;
a yellow-transparent middle layer and a dark blood-red top layer.

However, and as also reported in other publications, an addition of 2 %
of beryllium carbonate should create the best possible and brightest
tomato red uranium glazes.

F. H. Norton <sup>81)</sup> mentioned in 1952 the calcium and sodium
uranates as suitable for the development of brilliant red, orange and
yellow colours but pointed also out that ‘present restrictions make
their use in ceramics impossible’.

Two articles of Fritz Jochmann <sup>82, 83)</sup> published in 1958 and
1959 respectively are given some more information about the reactions
with uranium compounds in glass. Glasses, no matter which composition,
coloured with the normal available uranium compounds, resulted in
yellowish-greenish fluorescence when melted under oxidizing conditions
Reducing conditions resulted in a smoke-like greyish brown. In these
cases he drew a parallel between copper-ruby caused by (reduced) copper
in a colloidal state. The greyish-brown colour developed under reducing
conditions should be created by uranium, also in a colloidal state.

An investigation to the radioactivity of the uranium glasses of his
study was subject of the second part of the first publication. Concluded
was e.g. that the glass composition as such had absolutely no influence
on the radiation. Also the manufacturing procedures of the glasses
(melting at rather high temperatures) did not influence the radiation.
The only measure for radiation was the amount of uranium in the glass.
Measuring the radiation of a glass composition before and after melting
showed no noticeable differences if one made a correction for the
melting weight factor. This factor must be understand as a difference in
weight between a mix of raw materials and the weight of the same mix
after melting, not involving the practical looses during melting.

Although the author pointed out the risks for the workers health when
applying these compounds, he indicated in his second article that the
compounds in question were available again when one had a special
allowance and if it were materials without the for fission necessary
U<sup>235</sup>. This point of view can be considered as overtaken. To
the more recent regulations in this respect we will revert later on.

Lehnhäuser <sup>84)</sup> listed the uranium compounds as colouring
compounds for glazes in 1959. Although he indicated that these
particular colouring compounds were expensive, he gave no special
restrictions for their use. For a good uranium red glaze he recommended
a SiO<sub>2</sub> content between 0.4 mol as a minimum and 1.3 mol as a
maximum. Other glaze components should be only
Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and PbO. As colouring component was applied
an addition of 20 % (sodium) urinate. An oversaturation should result in
a uranium-aventurine glaze, analogous to the iron-aventurines. The
influence of common used alkaline earth components is also mentioned.
The remark that the uranium compounds are toxic and must be treated as
lead is nowadays a too brief information regarding the important
radiation phenomenae for one’s health.

Another application of uranium compounds and mentioned by Viehweger
<sup>85)</sup> is in compositions for lustres. These type of lustres are
the resinate salts of metal oxides dissolved in volatile essential oils.
The preparation of this type of lustres is a very special one and
requires an experience to a high degree.

For a golden yellow luster one made e.g. first a uranium resinate (a
mixture of uranium nitrate and soft soap in the ratio 1: 1). This
uranium resinate is then applied with colophony, benzene and oil of
lavender. In the same book are also mentioned some glaze compositions
which have sodium uranate in their composition. These glazes should
realize a dark salmon coloured glaze. No special restrictions are given
for the application of these compounds in respect of the harmful
properties for the human health, except the information that the uranium
compounds may not be used anymore in the ceramic industry.

The fact that these compounds are no longer applied in the ceramic
sphere is mainly due to the very severe regulations and that those
compounds must be registered because of its radioactivity. The radiation
consists in fact of three different kinds of radiation. The α parts
consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. The radiation has only a reach of
5 cm and cannot pass the human skin. The β parts are in fact a fast
moving electron. They have a reach of roughly 1 meter. The third kind of
radiation is formed by the γ parts which are comparable with X-rays.
This kind of radiation can only be stopped by thick walls of concrete or
lead. This radiation is the cause of the so-called radiation disease.

The literature indicates that the characteristics of uranium red glazes
are based upon the formation of lead-uranate: PbO.2UO<sub>3</sub>. This
is the reason that only a lead silicate or lead-alumina-silicate forms a
suitable base glaze. The firing stability of these glazes was however
rather limited. The available literature mentions in general glazes
which develop a red colour at temperatures ranging from roughly 900 °C
till 1020 °C. The sensitivity for a not well balanced firing atmosphere
was more than normal compared with other glaze systems. Only oxidizing
firing conditions resulted in the required results. Also a slightly
reducing atmosphere caused already colour deviations, in most cases to
more brownish colour tones. Uranium glazes were also sensitive for
influence of sulphur. An addition of barium carbonate helped to suppress
the sensitiveness.

Another aspect which made the glazes less easy to apply was the fact
that in many cases sodium uranate was used as the colouring compound.
The high amount necessary for a sufficient colour development (between
15 and 25 %) gave the glazes an alkaline character with sometimes strong
leaching phenomenae, resulting in settling-down problems. The use of
setting-up agents was in most cases a necessity.

The sometimes varying quality grades of the uranium compounds was also
reason for deviating colour shades. Together with the high price of the
compounds and the meanwhile distinguished dangerous properties with
regard to the radiation made the glazes not suitable for industrial use
on a large scale. The restrictions were reasons that these glazes were
mainly applied on a limited scale for small pieces of art ware. Various
pieces of orange-red to red glazed ceramic pieces could be seen in
various factory musea e.g. of the Konakovo Faience Factory in Konakovo
(Russia).

For the lower temperatures (900 °C – 960 °C) it was often advised to
apply raw, unfritted glazes while for the higher temperatures (960 °C –
1020 °C) some sources in the literature mention that for those cases
fritted glazes would render better results.

A not proper glaze application often resulted in an irregular glaze and
colour appearance. A cloudy effect with different coloured glaze layers
was the result.

One used several salts to reach the required colour shades. The origin
of those compounds was not always clear, neither was the measure of
radiation. For colouring of the glazes the mainly applied uranium
compounds were:

>  *Name* *Formula*

>  Uranium dioxide UO<sub>2</sub>

>  Uranium trioxide UO<sub>3</sub>

>  Uranium oxide U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>

>  Sodium uranate Na<sub>2</sub>O.UO<sub>3</sub>

>  Sodium diuranate Na<sub>2</sub>O.2UO<sub>3</sub>

>  hydrated sodium diuranate
> Na<sub>2</sub>O.2UO<sub>3</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O

>  uranium nitrate
> UO<sub>2</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O

> 

Although not a red-giving composition but a main one in respect of the
application of uranium for the well known greenish-yellowish
fluorescence, the following composition is mentioned by Jochmann:

> 

>  Na<sub>2</sub>O 12.80 %

>  K<sub>2</sub>O 4.94

>  CaO 6.03

>  BaO 2.83

>  As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.21

>  UO<sub>3</sub> 0.58

>  SiO<sub>2</sub> 72.60

>  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_

>  99.99 %

The uranium was introduced through sodium uranate. If the glass was
melted under the proper oxidizing conditions it resulted in the required
yellowish fluorescence.

In those cases the uranium should be present as UO<sub>3</sub>.

The early uranium red glazes mentioned by Binns and Lyttl were based on
the following compositions:

K<sub>2</sub>O 0.12 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.12 SiO<sub>2</sub>
1.33

>  PbO 0.80

>  ZnO 0.08

> 

An addition of 20 % of sodium uranate should result in a cinnabar red
glaze for SK04a (1020 °C).

The base glaze:

>  K<sub>2</sub>O 0.04 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub> 0.12 SiO<sub>2</sub>
> 0.79

>  PbO 0.87

>  ZnO 0.09

together with an addition of 37 % sodium uranate resulted in a matt red
glaze for SK 04a (1020 °C).

Zimmermann mentioned the following compositions for orange-red glazes,
suitable at SK 07a till SK 03a (960 °C till 1040 °C):

>  PbO 1.00 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.175 SiO<sub>2</sub> 0.4 - 0.6

> 

>  K<sub>2</sub>O 0.10 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.175 SiO<sub>2</sub>
> 0.85

>  PbO 0.90

> 

>  PbO 0.90 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.175 SiO<sub>2</sub> 0.60

>  ZnO 0.10

For these compositions counted that an addition of 20 parts of sodium
uranate to 100 parts of base glaze was applied.

The study of Eska is detailed and built up in a very schematic way. The
glazes were fired at SK 08a (940 °C) and SK 05a (1000 °C). The below
mentioned glazes gave, according to the author, good red glazes:

>  PbO 1.00 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.10 SiO<sub>2</sub> 1.40

>  UO<sub>3</sub> 0.20

> 

>  BaO 0.10 - 0.20 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.10 SiO<sub>2</sub>
> 1.20 - 1.40

>  PbO 0.90 - 0.80 UO<sub>3</sub> 0.15

> 

>  PbO 0.90 - 0.80 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.10 SiO<sub>2</sub>
> 1.20 - 1.40

>  ZnO 0.10 - 0.20 UO<sub>3</sub> 0.20

The weather resistance was not always sufficient and the glazes were
heavily attacked. This as contrasted with glazes where the lead content
was partly replaced by fluorspar:

>  CaF<sub>2</sub> 0.10 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.10 SiO<sub>2</sub>
> 1.40

>  PbO 0.90 UO<sub>3</sub> 0.15

This glaze should give an intensive and deep bright red colour. The
surface of the glaze was a glossy one and the weather resistance was
good.

If part of the lead content was replaced by magnesium the investigator
observed an increased tendency for crazing and a matt surface.

The introduction of potassium resulted in bright red glossy glazes with
a good resistance. The following examples can be mentioned:

> 

>  K<sub>2</sub>O 0.10 - 0.20 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.10
> SiO<sub>2</sub> 1.60

>  PbO 0.90 - 0.80 UO<sub>3</sub> 0.15

> 

A too high an amount of sodium had a negative influence on colour,
glaze, surface and craze- and weather resistance. The sodium content may
not exceed 0.10 mol while as preferable SiO<sub>2</sub> content is
mentioned 0.40 mol to a maximum 0.80 mol.

Kautz gives some compositions for respectively green, yellow, ivory,
orange and red uranium based glazes. As possibility for a vermillion red
glaze he mentioned:

> 

>  Na<sub>2</sub>O 0.10 UO<sub> </sub> 0.20 SiO<sub>2</sub> 2.00

>  PbO 0.90

> 

A good tomato red glaze for SK 07a (960 °C) with good processing
properties is mentioned by Eggert. As base glaze was used:

> 

>  PbO 1.00 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.10 SiO<sub>2</sub> 1.80

> 

The basic red glaze was made with an addition of 16.7 % black uranium
oxide UO<sub>3</sub>, this to avoid the simultaneous but unwanted sodium
introduction. These glaze components were not fritted before, but
applied as raw glazes. As components with a negative influence on both
the red colour and the glaze appearance are mentioned: calcium
carbonate, boric acid and rutile. A more matt surface was supported by
the introduction of e.g. tin oxide (8 %), barium carbonate (5 %),
tungsten acid (2 %) and molybdenum acid (2 %). Components which radiate
a positive influence on the red colour are zinc oxide (8 %), magnesium
oxide (5 %), lithium carbonate (5 %) and beryllium carbonate (2 %).

Viehweger mentioned a fire-red, opaque matt glaze with following
composition: ZnO 2.55 %

>  PbO 64.08

>  Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 5.41

>  SiO<sub>2</sub> 11.02

>  Na<sub>2</sub>U<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> 16.94

>  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

>  100.00 %

An orange-red opaque glaze for SK 05a – 03a (1000 °C – 1040 °C) had the
following composition: Na<sub>2</sub>O 3.81 %

>  CaO 5.35

>  PbO 24.38 fritted

>  Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 5.04

>  B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 5.28

>  SiO<sub>2</sub> 36.14

>  UO<sub>3</sub> 15.00

Another application of uranium salts is also mentioned, namely in the
composition of some coloured lustres. For this purpose one first made a
resinate which is than dissolved in a colophony and various essential
oils such as oleum rosmarini, oleum lavendular, oleum spicae, oleum
foeniculi and others. Uranium nitrate was used to produce brilliant,
iridescent lustres of a yellow colour. For the necessary uranium
resinate one dissolved the uranium nitrate and soft soap in a separate
way. The solutions were then poured together under the forming of a
resinate. This resinate must be washed, air-dried and could then be
used. A golden-yellow luster was then prepared using following
composition:

>  uranium resinate 25.0 parts

>  colophony 25.0

>  benzene 25.0

>  oil of lavender 25.0

The colophony was first dissolved in the oil of lavender using moderate
heat. Then the uranium resinate was added, followed by the benzene.
After cooling the liquid was first filtered before it was stored in
bottles.

Apart from that, Viehweger stated that it was no longer allowed to use
uranium compounds in the ceramic sphere. The already before mentioned
reasons were a cause that the application of these type of glazes felt
into abeyance.

Photograph 15 shows the uranium glaze which is in all respect a specific
one and therefore difficult to replace by other colouring compounds.

Nowadays we can only wonder that the use of these compounds was rather
wide spread. Till the 2<sup>nd</sup> World War however, when all uranium
compounds were claimed for nuclear investigations, it was a way to
create orange and red ceramic colours which was impossible to do in
another way. Still today, the glazes have a very good, nice and
brilliant appearance. There are various examples in factory musea in
several countries which I have seen and the tomato red colour was still
impressive. An example is shown by photograph 15. It shows an uranium
glaze made by the famous ceramic factory Mobach in Utrecht / The
Netherlands. This and other uranium based glazes were made around 1930.

Another example is the Homer Laughlin factory in East Liverpool - Ohio /
USA. They make the so-called Fiesta ware (dinnerware in earthenware) in
various colours ever since 1936. It included at that time a red-orange
colour which was made through a uranium red glaze (Photograph 16).

In 2001 a comprehensive article was published by Donna Strahan
<sup>86)</sup>. The article is a survey of over 400 glass, ceramic and
enamel objects from museum and private collections. It is an
investigation for the extent of uranium colorants, mainly produced
between 1830 till 1940. It shows that uranium colorant was widely used
in glass and ceramic and also that little health risk was found from the
uranium containing objects.

10\. CADMIUM SELENIUM

A ceramic creation of real red colours

Before describing the ins and outs of producing and application of
cadmium selenium red, orange and yellow glazes a short description is
given about the colour forming and therefore essential elements
selenium, cadmium and sulphur.

10.1. Selenium

In 1818 the Swedish scientists and chemists Jons Jakob Berzelius and
J.G. Gahn discovered and isolated the element selenium which is called
after ‘Selene’, the Greek word for moon. In the Greek mythology Selene
was the daughter of Hyperioon and sister of Helios. As selenium was
found when Berzelius was working with and investigating the element
tellurium and because there are similarities between these two elements
he choose for the name of selenium. The element tellurium was named
after the Latin word Tellus which means earth. In that way the
similarities as between Earth and Moon were also expressed in the names
of the elements.

Selenium, with atom number 34, has an atomic weight of 78.96. Its
melting point is 217 °C; the boiling point is 684.9 °C ± 1 °C. The
specific gravity is 4.79. Some of the natural sources of selenium are
the minerals crooksite (CuTlAg)<sub>2</sub>Se and clausthalite (PbSe).
The main source, however, of industrial Se (and Te) is the anode slib
which is formed during the electrolytic purification of copper. Major
producers of selenium in the world are Japan, Canada, Belgium, the US,
Russia and Germany.

The price of selenium has long been on a stable and low level but has
increased incredibly as from 2003. Reason for this is the enormous
demand for selenium from China for application in the ceramic and glass
industry as well as fertilizer for the Chinese soil. A general price
level in 2000 was US\$ 5.50/kg but in 2009 it was already increased to
US\$ 88.10/kg and increasing. See also Table IX which shows the
remarkable price increase shortly after 2003.

Selenium is mainly used in glass manufacturing (50 %), chemicals &
pigments (15 %), metallurgy (13 %), electronics (10 %) and others, like
agriculture (2 %). It plays also a role in nutricity and is mentioned,
together with vitamin A and vitamin E, to have an effect on slowing down
the grow of cancercells.<sup>87)</sup>

The electrical properties of the element are important (semi-conductor
application in the electronic industry) as well as the photoconductor
properties (changes light into electrical energy). The application as
photoreceptor in photocopiers was very important for a long period but
is nowadays more and more replaced by organic based photoreceptors. Also
its role as semi-conductor is taken over by pure silicon.

The application in the glass industry is still important. It is a
so-called decolourant: the greenish colour of glass caused by iron
impurities can be neutralized by small additions of selenium to make it
more colourless. Another application is of course the one as colourant
to create rubin-red colours.

Selenium dioxide (SeO<sub>2</sub>) is by far the most important oxide of
selenium. It is soluble in water and forms seleneous acid
H<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>3</sub>. By oxidation of seleneous acid e.g. by
HClO<sub>3</sub>, selenic acid H<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>4</sub> arises.
Salts of selenic acid like e.g. BaSeO<sub>3</sub>, ZnSeO<sub>3</sub> and
Na<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>3</sub> are used as sources of Se. Some of them
are in particular of importance at the manufacturing of CdSe glazes.
Na<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>3</sub> has the disadvantage that it is highly
hygroscopic.

10.2. Cadmium

The element cadmium is called after the Greek word ‘kadmeia’. This is
the ancient name for calamine = zinc carbonate.

Cadmium, with atomic number 48, has an atomic weight of 112.41. Its
melting point is 320.9 °C and the boiling point is 765 °C. The specific
gravity of the element is 8.65.

The element is discovered in 1817. Stromeyer found it as an impurity in
zinc carbonate. Cadmium most often occurs in small quantities associated
with zinc ores such as sphalerite (ZnS). Greenocktite (CdS) is the only
mineral of any consequence bearing cadmium.

Almost all cadmium is obtained as a by-product in the treatment of zinc,
copper and lead ores. This fact that cadmium is a component in zinc ores
hasn’t always been distinguished in the past. The way how zinc metal was
produced in an industrial way was started in the beginning of the
19<sup>th</sup> century. Knowing now that the cadmium, present in the
zinc ores, was also reduced to the cadmium metal, it escaped during the
process. Now, more than a hundred years later, this uncontrolled part of
the process is a serious source of environmental contamination.

Calamine mines were already explored for centuries in some European
countries for the production of brass. So also those mines near Moresnet
in the Altenberg (la Vieille Montagne) in Belgium. On March 24, 1806 the
chemist Abbé J. J. D. Dony from Liège was the new owner. In 1808 he
started with the production of metallic zinc using horizontal retorts in
St. Leonard, a suburb of Liège. Due to a lack of capital and business
view, the main part of this company was sold to Dominique Mosselman, a
businessman from Brussels. This new alliance was the base for the
founding of the ‘Société des Mines et fonderies de La Vieille Montagne’
in 1837.<sup>88)</sup>

The three developed processes for the manufacturing of metallic zinc are
all based on the very same principle, viz. the heating of calamine with
cokes; a distillation of zinc.

The ‘English method’ is called after the method developed by William
Champion. A patent was granted to him in 1739. According to this method,
the first zinc kilns were built in Warmley near Bristol in 1734.

The ‘Liège method’ with horizontal retorts started in 1809 but became of
any importance only after ± 1840.

The ‘Silesian method’, using half cylindrical shaped retorts was
developed by Johann Christian Ruhberg in 1798.

A fundamental change in processing was the development of the
electrolytic manufacturing of zinc. The first patents were granted
already in 1880 but it became important for the industry after ± 1920.
If one considers that e.g. the zinc factory as the one in Budel (North
Brabant - The Netherlands), which was founded in 1892 by Lucien and Emil
Dor and started production with only 8 small kilns according to the
‘Liège method’, switched over to the electrolytic process in 1973, one
can imagine how much cadmium is also ‘produced’ and released through the
chimney and the slags. These slags were given to the local farmers and
used for elevation of local roads etc. The community is now confronted
with the fact that a great number of hectares are contaminated with the
toxic dust from this 170,000 tons zinc p/a producing factory
<sup>89)</sup>.

The world production of cadmium amounts 15,000 to 20,000 tons p/a
<sup>90)</sup>. More than half of this amount is delivered by the USA,
Mexico and Canada. Also Russia is an important producer. A minor amount
is delivered now by Belgium, France and Germany.

Cadmium is used in thin metal coatings to prevent it from atmospherical
influences. As metallic material it forms the negative pole in
nickel-cadmium batteries. Cadmium is also a component in some
low-melting eutectic alloys as solders for lead.

The brown coloured cadmium oxide CdO can be obtained by the combustion
and oxidizing of the metal. Together with cadmium carbonate
(CdCO<sub>3</sub>, white powder) it is the most important raw material
source for the manufacturing of CdSe glazes. The yellow cadmium sulfide
(CdS) occurs in nature as greenocktite but it is chemically produced by
precipitation from solutions of cadmium salts. After precipitation it
has a cubic structure but after calcining it has a hexagonal crystal
structure which makes it a stable pigment. The cadmium pigments do have
very good properties for application in polymers. This has always been
by far the most important application of cadmium pigments what is also
expressed in Table X showing the use of cadmium pigments in Germany in
1981 <sup>91)</sup>.

The price of cadmium showed a high peak during the early part of this
century (2006) but has come down now and is more or less stable as shown

The toxicity of cadmium is already subject of all kind of
investigations, regulations, discussions and restrictions for use after
the Itai Itai disease in Japan became a world-issue. Mining in the
Toyama Prefecture by the Mitsui Mining and Smelting Co. was already done
since long times. The Kamioka Mines in Toyama increased the output of
the mines due to the wartime demands for zinc, lead and other metals
caused by the Russian Japanese war and World War I. The output increased
significantly before World War II and so did the cadmium contamination.
The waste water contaminated the Jinzu river and all water what was used
for preparing food, washing, drinking, fishing and irrigation of the
rice fields.

The main cause of the disease was determined in 1955 by Dr. Hagino
followed by investigations of the Toyama prefecture in 1961. In 1968 a
statement was issued by the Ministry of Health and Welfare mentioning
the symptoms of itai itai disease caused by cadmium poisoning. The
cadmium poisoning is mainly causing weakening of the bones and kidney
failure.

Various conferences were held on national, European and a world-wide
scale focusing on cadmium with the unavoidable outcome to come to
minimizing the application of cadmium with only some minor exceptions.
During the 80ties and 90ties of last century the application of cadmium
for most applications is forbidden and laid down in laws. Only some
exceptions are made were it is technically not possible to substitute
the cadmium by other alternatives. Ceramic colour application is e.g.
still an exception.

***10.3. Sulphur**.*

The element Sulphur (Sanskrit: sulvere; Latin: sulphurium) with symbol S
was already known to the ancients; referred to in the book of Genesis as
brimstone. It is also a component of gunpowder (together with potassium
nitrate and charcoal) which was invented by the Chinese in the
12<sup>th</sup> century.

Sulphur is also found in meteorites. A dark area near the crater
Aristarchus on the moon has been studied by R.W. Wood with UV light.
This study suggests strongly that it is a sulphur deposit.

It is widely distributed in nature as iron pyrites, galena (PbS),
sphalerite (Zn,Hg)S, cinnabar (HgS), stibnite, gypsum, Epsom salts,
celestite, barite, etc.

The element sulphur has atomic number 16. Its atomic weight is 32.06.
The melting point for the rhombic form is 112.8 °C and for the
monoclinic form 119.0 °C. The boiling point is 444.7 °C. The specific
gravity of the rhombic form is 2.07 and of the monoclinic form 1.96 (20
°C).

It is commercially recovered also from wells sunk into the salt domes
along the Gulf Coast of the USA. It is obtained from these wells by the
Frasch process which forced heated water into the wells to melt the
sulphur that is than brought to the surface.

Sulphur is a pale yellow, odorless, brittle solid which is insoluble in
water but soluble in CS<sub>2</sub>. In every state, whether gas, liquid
or solid, elemental sulphur occurs in more than one allotropic form of
modification. They present a confusing multitude of forms whose
relations are not yet fully understood.

A finely divided form of sulphur, known as ‘flower-of-sulphur’, is
obtained by sublimation.

A main application of sulphur is at the vulcanization of natural and
synthetic rubber and as fungicide. A tremendous tonnage is used to
produce sulfuric acid, one of the world’s most important manufactured
chemicals. In 2001 the world production of sulfuric acid was 165 million
tons <sup>92)</sup>.

For the manufacturing of ceramic red and yellow glazes the more
important compounds are cadmium sulfide and zinc sulfide. In old recipes
one can still find the introduction of the necessary amount of sulphur
by the yellow element as flower-of-sulphur. Investigations have,
however, proven that this is a less good method of introducing sulphur
into the formulation of frits and glazes.

10.4. Development of frits and glazes

The use of cadmium selenium glazes in their actual compositions does not
have such a long tradition. The base for the development of these glazes
however can be found in the use of Se in glass. The knowledge how to
obtain red colours in glass by using Se extended more and more in the
second part of the 19<sup>th</sup> century after Berzelius has isolated
the element in 1818.

Although it is clear that selenium based rose till reddish coloured
glasses were already known for a longer time, it is generally accepted
that the patent granted to the French chemist Théophile Jules Pelouze in
1865 was an important step for the development of the CdSe based glass
compositions. As far as known it is the first patent where Se is claimed
to be the colouring component for red glasses. T. J. Pelouze (1807 –
1867) did a lot of investigations e.g. in Germany for Liebig. He
invented e.g. the preparation of formic acid starting from cyano
hydrogen acid.

The next step was a patent of Welz, granted in 1892 for the use of Se or
Se compounds for producing rose, red and orange coloured glass.

In 1893 a British patent was granted to H. T. and W. R. von Kralik for
the use of Se and its compounds in glass manufacturing.

In 1894 Spitzer obtained a German patent for the use of selenites and
selenates.

From this time the ruby coloured glass on a basis of Cd, S and Se was a
subject of investigation for various scientists. It was known that the
ruby glasses based on colloidal gold developed their real colour after
an annealing process. A same kind of behavior was noticed for the ruby
glasses based on Se. Therefore, it was generally believed that the
particle sizes of the colouring particles were decisive for the final
colour. Investigators to these phenomena were e.g. Treadwell, Fenaroli,
Kraze, Witt, Frankel, Krak, Granger, Fuwa and Sugie.

An important step for the investigations was made by Rooksby and
published in 1932. He investigated the red coloured glasses using the
XR-Diffraction method. He stated for the first time that the mixed
crystals of the solid solution of CdS and CdSe are responsible for
colouring. The final colour, between yellow and dark red, is depending
on the ratio CdS : CdSe in the mixed crystal. The more CdSe the darker
red the colour.

Bigelow and Silverman <sup>93)</sup> confirmed the conclusions as found
by Rooksby in an investigation published in 1933. They started with
following sodium-zinc-silica glasses:

>  Na<sub>2</sub>O : ZnO : 8SiO<sub>2</sub>

>  Na<sub>2</sub>O : ZnO : 7SiO<sub>2</sub>

>  Na<sub>2</sub>O : ZnO : 6SiO<sub>2</sub>

>  Na<sub>2</sub>O : ZnO : 5SiO<sub>2</sub>

>  Na<sub>2</sub>O : ZnO : 4SiO<sub>2</sub>

>  Na<sub>2</sub>O : 2ZnO : 4SiO<sub>2</sub>

2Na<sub>2</sub>O : ZnO : 4SiO<sub>2</sub>

After a smelt study they took the glass according to the composition
Na<sub>2</sub>O : ZnO : 4 Si0<sub>2</sub> as a foundation glass. After a
great number of trial smelts they concluded that the best ruby glass was
obtained by adding 2.0 % selenium, 1.0 % cadmium sulfide, 1.0 % arsenic
trioxide and 0.5 % carbon to the basic glass batch. The glass made in
this way was annealed for 30 hours at 350 °C to 400 °C and further
subject for X-ray examinations. For this investigation they prepared
solid solutions of CdS and CdSe and compared this with the ruby coloured
glasses. As a result they found that the values for the lattice
parameters a<sub>o</sub> and c<sub>o</sub> and the ratio c<sub>o</sub> :
a<sub>o</sub> for both the solid solution and the colouring agent in the
glass had such an agreement that one could conclude that the colouring
agent in the glass was a solid solution of CdS and CdSe. This was a
confirmation of the results as found and published by Rooksby.

In 1934 a patent was granted to E. I. du Pont de Nemours in the USA
<sup>94)</sup>. In this patent it is claimed that a glass without
cadmium sulfide and/or selenium, is added an amount of cadmium
sulfoselenide (CdS.CdSe) together with elementary cadmium. Following the
patent it was possible to obtain the final colour directly after
quenching and it was no longer necessary to make use of an annealing
process. It may be noticed that they mentioned exactly the same glass
composition as published and used by Bigelow and Silverman, namely
Na<sub>2</sub>O : ZnO : 4 SiO<sub>2</sub>. In this patent it is already
stated that oxidizing batch components like nitrates must be avoided. On
the contrary, one must made use of reducing components such as carbon,
sugar or tartaric acid.

The second claim in this patent mentions that the selenium in the
cadmium sulfo selenide can be replaced partly by tellurium. Although
this is also mentioned in earlier publications it never has found a real
great application in the practice of ceramic glaze manufacturing.
Besides the reason of a less stable colouring result with tellurium, the
price is also very important. An indication for the price, valid per
28.12.2007, for selenium metal is US\$ 60/kg and for tellurium US\$
137.50/kg <sup>95)</sup>

Before WW-II the classical CdSSe pigments were applied for onglaze
decoration firing, for colouring porcelain enamels and only to a minor
extent as a ceramic stain. These types of products were fired at abt.
800 °C for 15 minutes and the pigments of that time could just stay at
those firing temperatures. From there, during the 50ties, the pigments
were also started to be applied in low firing glazes which were first
based upon the formulation of porcelain enamel frits. As the final
results were very attractive, one started to improve the pigments as
well as the glazes to make them more suitable for higher firing
temperature glazes. <sub> </sub>

> 

> During the 50ties and 60ties of last century there were mainly two
> ways to produce the yellow and red CdSe glazes viz. a pigmented type
> and a melted-in type. For the yellow pigmented type one added a CdS to
> a suitable base glaze resulting in a bright yellow glaze with,

> following composition:

> 

>  base frit (PbO and CdO containing) 94.50 %

>  cadmium sulphide 2.50

>  cadmium carbonate 2.00

>  bentonite 1.00

>  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

>  100.00 %

> 

For red glazes there was a similar way: on one hand the method of adding
a CdSSe pigment to a suitable base glaze and on the other hand a
melted-in method. The latter method rendered better results for firing
stability and had also a better firing range.

An example of a very clear, bright and real red pigmented glaze as used
during the late 60ties and early 70ties of last century was following:

> 

>  base frit (PbO and CdO containing) 91.85 %

>  boric acid 4.50

>  quartz fine 1.50

>  calcium phosphate 0.80

>  red stain CdSSe 1.35

>  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

>  100.00 %

> 

The base frit was dry milled first. The boric acid, quartz and calcium
phosphate were mixed separately first and later added. The complete
receipt was dry mixed.

Both methods, the pigmented as well as the melted-in method, however,
were not stable enough for the ceramic industry which started to demand
for more stable glazes and for CdSe glazes suitable for higher firing
temperatures. In the late 50ties and early 60ties of last century the
melted-in reds had already a better firing stability compared to the
pigmented types. Some sources mention Mondré & Manz as being the first
company which brought melted-in CdSe glaze on the market, followed by
Reimbold & Strick, Degussa and Ferro (Holland) B.V. There is a brochure
dated 20<sup>th</sup> January 1961 where Ferro (Holland) B.V. announced
that they have a stable red cadmium selenium glaze for firing at 980 °C
– 1000 °C. This glaze, with reference number 55148, was a pigmented
glaze. The melted-in type of glazes followed later. Also in 1961 a
patent was turned in by W. Wanie <sup>96)</sup> and published in 1969.
The patent describes a method (example 1) to obtain a red colour by
applying 18 weight percent of a CdSSe pigment and in the other examples
it claimed the development of red colours by melting in all relevant
components in one frit. The patent has been opposed at the time by
Mondré & Manz and Ferro (Holland) BV.

In the 60ties of last century these glazefrit formulations for the
melted-in CdSe glazes were basically derived from the red glass
compositions. The basic idea was that the red colour was based on the
mixed crystal of CdS.CdSe and so the frit compositions had these
components in their composition. Some improvements were realised by
making other choices for the raw materials like e.g. sodium- or zinc
selenites instead of the elements Se as metal and zinc sulphide as
sulphur source instead of S as flower-of-sulphur.

As some typical base frit compositions for melted-in yellow glazes at
that time can be mentioned:

>  Na<sub>2</sub>O 0.284 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.098
> SiO<sub>2</sub> 2.380

>  K<sub>2</sub>O 0.062 B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.122 S 0.083

>  BaO 0.283

>  ZnO 0.335

>  CdO 0.036

> 

or Na<sub>2</sub>O 0.242 SiO<sub>2</sub> 1.667

>  BaO 0.262 S 0.046

>  CdO 0.031

>  ZnO 0.465

> 

In most cases the cadmium was introduced as cadmium oxide and the
sulphur as zinc sulphide. These frits were the basic frits for yellow
melted-in cadmium glazes. The milling formulae of the glazes had often 2
% of cadmium carbonate to support and stabilize the colour development.

A typical glaze composition for a melted-in type of yellow glaze was as
follows:

>  basic frit containing Cd and S 60 %

>  supporting frit containing Pb and Cd 21

>  addition frit lead free 7

>  cadmium carbonate 2

>  kaolin 4

>  ball clay 6

>  \_\_\_\_\_\_

>  100 %

> 

It was clear that one had to create certain conditions with regard to
the compositions of the yellow and red glaze frits to realize a good
colour development and to avoid all kinds of ceramic defects such as
crater-forming, boiling, burning-away of the colour, etc.

The fact that compositions of yellow and red glazes are restricted in
their compositions is also illustrated by the following fact. Table XII
shows analyses made in 1972 <sup>97)</sup> of four cadmium yellow glazes
of four different manufacturers. As can be seen, the compositions do not
deviate that much. All four glazes are in general comparable after
firing although they differ on minor points.

The fact that frit and glaze compositions often have a preferred
composition for the best possible development of a given colour is well
known in ceramics. This is certain so in case of cadmium yellow and red
frits and glazes. What the analyses, however, does not tell is how the
different glazes have been manufactured. For sure, each of the glazes is
built up from various frits. How these different frit compositions
differ and, even more important, how these frits have been manufactured
cannot be seen from the analyses neither the milling formulae of the
glazes.

>  Analyses of 4 different cadmium yellow glazes.

> 

The development for a more stable glaze formulation was soon focused on
the splitting up of the basic frits. From many trials it became clear
that the optimum melting conditions for one component (S) worked out
very negative for the other component (Cd). Investigations at the
various frits learned that the loss of cadmium can easily go up to 80 %
due to volatilization during the melting of the frit <sup>98)</sup>. In
case the melting conditions were not optimal the cadmium oxide could
rather easily be reduced to cadmium metal which is even more volatile
than cadmium oxide <sup>99)</sup>. Also the melting temperature had a
dramatic effect on the retaining of the cadmium in the frit.
Investigations clearly showed that bringing down the melting temperature
from 1450 °C to 1350 °C while maintaining the same yield resulted in a
50 % less loss of cadmium oxide in the molten frit. The combination of
these two facts and information as e.g. from the German patent 2 023 710
from Hercules Inc. was the start for a study for the development of a
new generation of base frits for cadmium yellow and red glazes. The
start was made by splitting up the basic (Cd + S) frit for yellow glazes
in a frit containing the cadmium and another part containing the sulphur
and in such a way that the two frits together matched the same original
basic frit again. Next step was to melt the splitted frits under three
different melting conditions, viz. oxidizing, neutral and reducing
melting conditions. See also Table XIII. For the oxidizing conditions
the choice was made in the end for the introduction of 2 % sodium
nitrate in the raw batch composition. For the reducing conditions a
choice was made for melting with less air and with a reducing agent in
the batch composition. After testing various possibilities carbon (C )
was taken as the reducing agent. Also sugar was tried but was less
effective. SiC was also tested with good reducing properties but the
disadvantage was that it causes contamination of the frit and later
contamination of glazes in the mills resulting in pinholes.

Testing of the application of carbon as reducing agent learned that a
quantity of 2 % was the optimum; 1 % was less effective and more than 2
% didn’t render better results. These six frits (see Table XIII) were
tested again in the standard glaze composition by making combinations of
resp. the oxidizing melted Cd frit (i) with the three different molten S
frits (iv, v and vi); the neutral melted Cd frit (ii) with the three
different molten S frits (iv, v and vi) and the reduced melted Cd frit
(iii) with the three different molten S frits (iv, v and vi). The
results clearly confirmed that the cadmium frit needed different
smelting conditions as the sulphur containing frit. By combining the
cadmium frit melted under oxidizing conditions (i) and the sulphur
containing frit melted under reducing conditions (vi), the final results
were significant better compared to the original yellow glaze formula.

Next step was to realize a really low-melting frit for the cadmium
component as this had shown that it was the best way to retain as much
as possible cadmium in the frit. Normally, an addition of the cadmium
frit in the glaze composition was rather high to have a contribution of
about 2 till 3 % of cadmium oxide through the frit. As the influence of
a high amount of frit with low melting compositions should be too big in
the glaze compositions, the choice was made for a cadmium content as
high as possible in the low melting frit compositions. Two different low
melting compositions were chosen as starting point, viz. a lead silicate
and a sodium boron silicate. In the lead silicate the one mol PbO was
partly replaced by CdO:

> \(a\) PbO 0.50 SiO<sub>2</sub> 2.00

>  CdO 0.50

and in the sodium boron silicate the sodium was partly replaced by CdO:

> 

> \(b\) Na<sub>2</sub>O 0.50 B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.25
> SiO<sub>2</sub> 2.50

>  CdO 0.50

> 

These two frits were tested in combination with the same S-containing
frit (vi) to control its effectiveness. From all trials it appeared very
clearly that the cadmium frit based on the lead silicate gave a good
yellow colour but only till rather low firing temperatures (1040 °C –
1060 °C). The cadmium frit based on the sodium boron silicate, however,
showed good and strong yellow colour development also on higher firing
temperatures. It was known that about 80 % of the cadmium was
evaporating from the basic frits having both cadmium and sulphur in its
composition. Therefore, the amount of cadmium in the new trial frits was
investigated. The theoretical amount of CdO in the batch formula of the
frit (b) is 24.38 %. After melting the amount was 24.02% which means a
loss of only 2 %. A tremendous improvement was realised with regard to
retaining of the cadmium in the frit. One of the reasons was that a
choice was made for easy and quick melting raw materials as boric acid
and hydrated borax. The idea behind it was that these components start
to melt very early. When boric acid is heated it gradually looses water
until anhydrous boric acid (B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) is formed
<sup>100)</sup>. This boric oxide melts at about 325 °C. Borax
(Na<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub>.10H<sub>2</sub>O), on heating,
begins to melt at 62 °C with frothing and five molecules of the
crystallisation water have been lost at 100 °C. Four more molecules are
lost at 160 °C until it is completely dehydrated at 400 °C. In fritting
processes borax pentahydrate
(Na<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub>.5H<sub>2</sub>O) is also often
used. Dehydrated borax starts melting at 741 °C and is therefore a
preferred material to starts the melting process during fritting. The
early start of melting of boric compounds takes care that the cadmium
oxide is already enwrapped by the molten boron components before going
into solution and cannot evaporate that easy.

The following step was trying to improve the sulphur containing frit. By
varying the amount of suphur and also the source of it, it became clear
that an amount of 1 % was the optimum. With 2 % sulphur or more a lot of
bubbles appeared in the fired glaze which was even worse with 3 %. The
introduction of S through zinc sulphide (ZnS) was shown the best one
regarding the retaining and the stability of the frit. Variations of the
components learned following:

aluminium oxide : makes the compositions too hard at rather low

>  percentage (4 %).

soda : is not harmful for the yellow colour development

>  very smooth surfaces can be realised, however, the

>  influence on the coefficient of expansion becomes

>  too big.

borax : an amount between 5 and 15 % is not disadvanta-

geous for the yellow colour. A bigger amount in-

creases the forming of the vein structure of the glaze.

quartz : not disadvantageous.

zinc oxide : if more than 10 % is put into the formulae it has a

clearly negative influence on the yellow colour

development

barium carbonate : at quantities varying between 0 and 20 % no negative

>  influence has been noticed.

zinc sulphide : is needed for the necessary amount of sulphur

fluorspar : negative effect: forming of matt spots and craters.

calcium carbonate : not negative for the yellow colour. Bigger amount

makes the glaze too hard.

strontium carbonate : same as for calcium carbonate

carbon / norit : is necessary as reducing agent.

All these testing of different raw materials finally resulted in a
stable frit with a strong yellow colour development. Lithium was also
tested, replacing part of the sodium content. It resulted in a very
smooth surface at temperatures of 980 °C – 1020 °C but the strength of
the yellow colour became less, especially at the sharp rims of darker
coloured bodies and at higher temperatures (1080 °C – 1120 °C).

All the investigations resulted in the following basic sulphur
containing frit:

> 

>  Na<sub>2</sub>O 0.467 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.129
> SiO<sub>2</sub> 2.346

>  K<sub>2</sub>O 0.052 B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.112 S 0.077

>  CaO 0.173

>  ZnO 0.308

This sulphur containing frit melted at about 1350 °C under reducing
conditions (meaning with less air than normal and including a reducing
agent in the batch formula), together with the cadmium containing frit
melted at 1250 °C under oxidizing conditions was the base for a new
strong cadmium yellow melted-in glaze. Its colour strength was compared
to the standard cadmium yellow glazes by mixing 50 parts of the yellow
glazes with 50 parts of a standard cadmium red glaze. With this test it
was clear that the new frit combination gave a much more yellow-orange
colour compared to the ‘old’ frits which was an indication that the new
yellow glaze had more colour strength compared to the old glaze
composition.

Now having the best possible cadmium and sulphur base frits, the next
step was trying to find the best possible glaze composition which should
fit the requirements as covering power and colour strength also on dark
manganese bodies, covering power on sharp rims of cups and saucers,
firing stability on high firing temperatures as high as 1200 °C, etc.
Various addition frits were tested among them high and low lead
containing frits, very stable and proven unleaded alkali-calcium frits,
high barium containing frits, zinc containing frits, etc. and finally
the best composition was found:

basic sulphur containing frit 48 parts

>  basic cadmium containing frit 7 parts

>  transparent u/l addition frit 32 parts

>  sodium boron silicate 8 parts

>  ball clay 5 parts

>  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

>  100 parts

This glaze was tested at customers under various firing conditions and
production conditions, on various bodies (white, red and manganese brown
burning), at both wall- and floor tiles and at vases and dinnerware and
showed good colour strength even at 1200 °C. One of the best and very
temperature stable cadmium yellow glazes with high colour strength was
born <sup>101)</sup>. This glaze is still promoted and in the market as
can be seen in Ferro’s Technical Information GL07.

As can be noticed no addition of cadmium carbonate was necessary anymore
to stabilize the yellow colour. This was an improvement regarding the
health and safety regulations besides the economical advantage. The
glaze powder was tested according to the stomach acid simulation test
(¼N HCl for 1 hour) and the lead- and cadmium release was found below
the limits set. Also a lead- and cadmium release test with 4 % acetic
acid for 24 hours (DIN EN 1388-1/-2) showed a release below the limits
as set for this test.

The investigations continued with the aim to improve the existing red
cadmium selenium glazes in the same way as the yellow glazes. Till the
end of the 60ties – early 70ties the basic frits contained cadmium as
well as sulphur and selenium. Also here, a split was made in the way
that the necessary amount of cadmium was introduced through the new
developed and low melting and concentrated cadmium frit. The sulphur was
in most cases introduced already through zinc sulphide. The necessary
amount of selenium was introduced through an alkaline selenite, mostly
sodium selenite (Na<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>3</sub>) or zinc selenite
(ZnSeO<sub>3</sub>).

Now a switch is made to the manufacturing of CdSSe red colour stains as
the development made in that area had later on a great impact on the
cadmium.selenium frit and glaze development. Till the end of the
19<sup>th</sup> century CdSSe stains were made in a dry way by mixing
the materials cadmium sulphide, sulphur and metallic selenium together
and heating the mix in a, sometimes rotating, kiln at about 600 °C.

Different manufacturers may have applied somewhat different combinations
of raw materials and firing conditions but this was the general basis.

It doesn’t ask that much imaginative faculty to realise that this method
was very much unhealthy and uneconomical due to the volatibility of the
selenium metal and also the cadmium compounds. This method was step by
step replaced by the wet-chemical precipitation method which was
invented by BASF in 1919. By this process the Se metal was dissolved in
Na<sub>2</sub>S. This solution was added to a cadmium salt solution. A
precipitate of cadmium-sulfo-selenide (CdSSe) was the result and this
precipitate was washed and dried at the proper temperature. By changing
the amounts of resp. cadmium, sulphide and selenium, but also with
additions of e.g., zinc oxide or aluminium oxide, one was able to
influence the colour tone of the pigment. This wet method replaced the
dry method more and more during the 20<sup>th</sup> century.

Following this process for the wet preparation of CdSSe stains, a method
was found in the early 70ties for a better introduction of these
components for the selenium frit production. This method was very
similar to the method of the wet preparation of CdSSe stains. Basically,
the cadmium was replaced by zinc and the following procedure was
followed:

\- zinc sulphate was dissolved in water of 50 °C and pumped into a
reaction

vessel

\- sodium carbonate was also dissolved in water of 50 °C and also pumped

into the reaction vessel

\- sodium sulphide was dissolved in water of 45 °C and a quantity of

selenium metal was added, stirred till it was dissolved

\- the sodium sulphide + selenium solution was pumped into the reaction

vessel resulting in a precipitate

\- washing of the precipitate and centrifuging of the washed material

\- drying of the material.

The reactions which took place were following:

ZnSO<sub>4</sub>.OH solution + Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> solution

(i) 3H<sub>2</sub>O + 5Zn<sup>2+</sup> + 5CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> →
2ZnCO<sub>3</sub>.3Zn(OH)<sub>2</sub> ↓ + 3CO<sub>2</sub> ↑

Na<sub>2</sub>S + Se solution

(ii) Na<sub>2</sub>S + Se → 2Na<sup>+</sup> + SSe<sup>2-</sup>

(i)  + (ii)

(iii) 2ZnCO<sub>3</sub>.3Zn(OH)<sub>2</sub> + SSe<sup>2-</sup> →
2ZnCO<sub>3</sub>.3ZnSSe ↓ + 6OH<sup>-</sup>

The resulting precipitate of zinc-sulfo-selenide (ZnSSe) was
centrifuged, dried and later on mixed with quartz in a ratio 1 : 3 for
better handling and weighing of the precipitate.

The precipitate of zinc-sulfo-selenide had the following typical
composition:

Se : 33.2 %

>  Zn : 35.7

>  S : 9.0

>  moisture : 6.2

>  H<sub>2</sub>O sol. : 0.7

The mixture of quartz and ZnSSe was used as raw material to introduce
the necessary S and Se in the basic frits for red glazes.

Also in these cases a significant improvement was realised with regards
to a decrease of the volatilization of the component selenium. Most of
the systems for making basic red frits of that time contained cadmium as
well as selenium and sulphur at the same time. Analyses of production
molten frits learned that up to 83 % of the cadmium disappeared after
melting. The figure for selenium was abt. 52 % and for the sulphur in
these type of frits abt. 91 %. A typical basic frit for cadmium red
glazes was:

>  quartz 56.77 %

>  sodium carbonate 20.80

zinc oxide 8.87

>  zinc sulphide 2.66

>  alum.oxide 2.80

>  boric acid 4.27

>  cadmium oxide 1.70

>  zinc selenite ZnSeO<sub>3</sub> 2.13

>  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

>  100.00 %

> 

The knowledge of the new frits as developed for the yellow frits and
glazes was transferred for the development for new basic frits for red
frits and glazes. Of course, the cadmium was separated from the basic
frits in the first place. The raw material zinc selenite as source for
Se was changed for the zinc-sulfo-selenide (ZnSSe) and the reduction
agent carbon was introduced into the raw batch formula. Some other small
adaptations were made in the composition but it is mainly the different
way of melting which made these types of frits much better with regard
to the red colour development and the colour strength <sup>102)</sup>.
An example of such a modified frit is:

>  quartz 56.73 %

>  sodium carbonate 20.73

>  zincoxide 10.50

>  zinc sulphide 0.67

>  alum.oxide 2.80

boric acid 4.23

>  norit 2.00

>  zinc-sulfo-selenide 2.33

>  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

>  100.00 %

> 

Through XR-F analyses a comparison was made between the ‘traditional’
melted frit and the new developed frit. Results are mentioned in Table

The important changes in the batch compositions of the sulphur frit for
yellow and the suphur/selenium frits for red were of course very
important for the retention of the red colour. However, the way of
melting was and is also important. It may be clear that an oxidizing
melting atmosphere was and is easier to obtain in a melting kiln
(continuous or batch/rotating) than a reducing atmosphere. Although one
speaks about a reducing atmosphere it is of course not possible to
create a real reducing atmosphere in e.g. a continuous melting kiln of
1.80m by 4.80m with a double feeding system and at melting temperatures
of about 1350 °C where a sufficient amount of gas and oxygen is
necessary to reach the smelting temperature and to maintain it as well.
A reducing atmosphere here means that the oxygen was reduced as far as
possible. Also the draught in the melting kiln could not be reduced
completely as this had a very negative effect on the quality of the
frit. The experience of how to melt these frits was very important and
also difficult to lay down in fixed instructions as it happened quite
often that one kiln reacted different than another similar melting kiln.
One of the measurements taken was to smelt a high viscosity zircon white
frit at temperatures as high as 1400 °C – 1425 °C before smelting a
production run of basic frits for red or yellow glazes. In this way the
bottom of the melting kiln had a smooth and stable surface when the
basic red and yellow frits followed at lower temperatures, e.g. 1350 °C.
The zircon frit stayed rather stiff at the bottom of the kiln and
experience learned that the basic frits for red and yellow glazes were
less contaminated and more stable. As many people involved in classical
ceramics know: ceramics is for a major part an empirical science. Trial
and error is for ceramic people a way of life. Production of cadmium
selenium frits and glazes has therefore always been a job which asked
the highest discipline and cooperation between the various people
involved from chemical and ceramic laboratories, production (melting,
milling, drying) and quality control.

With these new basic frits for cadmium selenium red glazes and together
with the earlier mentioned concentrated cadmium frit, it was possible to
create new and very stable cadmium selenium red glazes for all kind of
applications.

Besides the concentrated cadmium frit already mentioned, other
concentrated cadmium frits have been developed e.g. with the target to
develop CdSe glazes with a lower coefficient of expansion resulting in a
composition like:

> 

>  Na<sub>2</sub>O 0.353 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.054
> SiO<sub>2</sub> 3.871

>  K<sub>2</sub>O 0.137 B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.630

>  CdO 0.510

With this handful of basic frits it was very well possible to create an
endless range of CdSe glazes. During the 70ties, thousands of tons of
cadmium selenium yellow and red glazes were produced per year by the
various but only a handful of suppliers and applied onto wall- and floor
tiles, giftware, vases, dinnerware, etc. The production of these type of
glazes needed attention of people from ceramic development laboratory,
quality control, and the various production disciplines like melting and
milling department. To produce a given glaze every time to the same
colour and same characteristics, first a choice was made for the red and
yellow frits of specific batches out of a production run. This was done
because it could happen that some molten batches of red frits were more
red or less red than others. A small test was then made where the
specified frit batches were used in the milling formula of the glaze. In
case the result was approved, a production mill (e.g. 5 tons of
material) was charged with the specified batch references of the frits
involved and the production milling was started. After milling and
controlling the glaze slib was mixed with similar prepared glaze slib of
the same glaze reference before it was finally pumped to a spray drier.
In this way, manufacturers could make a stable glaze for colour and
colour strength all the time.

The ‘space’ in the glaze compositions between the sum of the necessary
basic selenium and cadmium frits and the total composition allowed
applying other frits which could answer certain demands from the market.
Especially here, this ‘space’ was utilized by technical ceramic
engineers to realize certain targets as set by customers. As there were
many customers with many different kilns and firing cycles, the
necessary adjustments were made using this ‘space’ in the glaze
composition. The advantage was that fairly quick a solution was found
for a given problem but the disadvantage was that there was a kind of
unlimited growth of new cadmium selenium glazes. As long as volumes
justified this way of working there were no problems but as soon as
volumes started to drop down the production had so its difficulties with
keeping up the quality, same colour and colour strength for all these,
sometimes only slightly, different glazes.

As an example how this space was utilized the various matt glaze
compositions can be mentioned. The space in the glaze composition was
partly filled up with a suitable matt frit, resulting in a nice and
stable matt red, orange or yellow glaze.

To realize the required matt surface structure, different matt frits
were used in different quantities and in combination with other
transparent basic frits to give e.g. good melting and flow properties to
the glaze. The particular choice which matt system should be used was
dictated by the kiln and firing conditions at the customer site and, of
course, which particular colour and surface structure was required.

>  BaO 1.000 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.500 SiO<sub>2</sub> 2.018

> 

Some other frequently used barium matt frits were e.g. frits with
following composition:

>  Na<sub>2</sub>O 0.032 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.324
> SiO<sub>2</sub> 2.061

>  K<sub>2</sub>O 0.066 B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.046

>  CaO 0.093

>  BaO 0.256

>  PbO 0.502

>  ZnO 0.051

> 

and BaO 0.400 SiO<sub>2</sub> 0.700

>  PbO 0.100

>  ZnO 0.500

> 

Together with this type of matt frits some special cadmium selenium
glazes for application onto floor tiles have been developed such as:

Matt red glaze through Ba-aluminate for 1080 °C – 18 hrs firing cycle:

>  basic red frit 28.2 %

>  basic yellow frit 31.6

>  basic cadmium frit 12.8

>  lead mono silicate 3.5

Ba-aluminate 16.2

>  kaolin 4.3

>  alum. oxide fine 3.4

>  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_

>  100.0 %

Another method for making matt cadmium selenium glazes was the addition
of barium carbonate and aluminium oxide in a certain ratio to existing
red and yellow glazes as also described in the German patent ref. 2 006
814 from Baykara <sup>104)</sup>.

Also more brilliant and glossy glazes could be made in that way like the
glaze which is used for the vase as shown with photo 1. In that
particular case a zircon white frit and a lead aluminum silicate frit
were used to obtain a very smooth and brilliant surface:

Cadmium selenium glazes for screen print application were specially
developed. Next to the basic red, yellow and cadmium frits, these glazes
contained frits with e.g. good flow properties. For application of those
glazes, in most cases over a zircon white glaze, a screen of 18T was
advised and a screen print medium based on e.g. polyethylene glycol.

The above mentioned glazes are examples of glazes which have been
developed and have been in production for a certain period, mainly in
the 70ties and 80ties of last century. Besides these glazes many more
glazes like these were developed in the same way. The glazes are
examples of how a certain surface, colour or effect can be realized by
making use of the ‘free space’ in the glaze formulae. This way of
working could only be done by the glaze manufacturers as basic red,
yellow and cadmium frits have never been free available on the
commercial market.

From the basic frits there have been developed various standard cadmium
selenium glazes which were directed already into a specific application,
e.g. for normal twice firing, for high firing / once firing, suitable
for wall- or floor tiles, for vases, giftware, white or coloured bodies,
etc.

Next to that the standard glazes were also used as starting points and
additions were given to develop a specific colour shade, surface
appearance, gloss, a higher abrasion resistance, etc. at customers’
site. Some of these additions were:

*material* *addition* *result*

corundum 10 to 30 parts higher abrasion resistance

zirconium silicate 10 to 30 parts higher abrasion resistance

mixture of wollastonite,

al.oxide, kaolin and

petalite 20 to 30 parts higher abrasion resistance

alkaline boron silicate 5 to10 parts to smoothen the surface and

increase gloss

lead alumina silicate 10 to 20 parts to increase gloss, less texture,

In this way many standard cadmium selenium glazes have been customized
to fit customers’ requirements technically and aesthetically. Some

These glazes were also often used in multi-layer application. As an
example for a floor tile glaze which has been applied in Italy on a 25cm
x 25cm floor tile:

1<sup>st</sup> layer : red glaze 50 parts application by disc

>  yellow glaze 50 application weight: 55 grs

>  corundum 150 20 wet

>  colour stain brown 1.5

>

>  corundum 150 20 wet

> 

4<sup>th</sup> layer: coloured frit 99.5 parts application by disc

>  bentonite 0.5 application weight: 10 grs

>  wet

The 4<sup>th</sup> coloured layer could be changed to achieve different
colour effects. Mono-firing 1160 °C – 60min. roller kiln.

Especially for single firing floor tiles with a dark firing body the
application of an engobe as 1<sup>st</sup> layer was often applied. Such
an engobe could have following composition:

>  Na/K/Ca/Al/B/Si transparent frit 5 %

>  feldspar (Na/K) 22

>  nepheline syenite 18

>  ball clay 33

>  aluminium oxide fine 11

>  kaolin 11

>  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

>  100 %

Knowing the extensive lines for glaze application for wall- and floor
tiles (mainly in Italy, Spain, Germany, Brasil and other countries) the
different methods were used to achieve various effects e.g. a
1<sup>st</sup> thin layer of a dark coloured glaze applied by (double)
disc followed by 2 or 3 different layers of different coloured cadmium
selenium glazes applied by a mottling technique. These glazes could
include different compounds to realize various surface effects or to
increase abrasion resistance.

Another example which shows how one could ‘tailor-made’ cadmium selenium
glazes is shown by photograph 19. This ceramic tableau called ‘Walking
Orange’ shows an outside of an orange which really looks like the real
outside of an orange: a matt grainy surface and a so-called orange peel
effect. The effect is created among other things by adding a course
aluminium oxide and other raw materials to a mixture of a red and a
yellow glaze. The inside, however, of the orange also looks exactly like
the real inside of an orange: this surface is more soft and glossy. This
is realised by adding soft lead fluxes the get a more shiny glaze. The
ratio red to yellow glaze is also different for the outside and for the
inside of the orange. The white veins are made by a stiffer zircon white
glaze.

## 

The a.m. glaze combinations show that one could realize many different
appearances of cadmium red glazes and made them suitable for each
existing firing cycle at that time. Later on in the 80ties of the last
century the trend colour changed and the cadmium red, orange and yellow
glazes started to disappear from the volume users: wall- and floor
tiles. For art- , gift- and tableware the trend continued and the glazes
are still applied today for these purposes.

## 

## 10.5 Defects

Although they are coloured glazes, the group of cadmium selenium
melted-in glazes is always prepared by the bigger glaze manufacturers.
It is not a coloured glaze in the sense of adding a colour stain to a
suitable transparent glaze to achieve the required colour. Only now,
with the last generation of strong cadmium selenium stains it is indeed
possible to add these (expensive) stains to a transparent glaze to
achieve a strong yellow, orange or red colour. But the group of cadmium
selenium glazes meant here are the so-called melted-in glazes. The
glazes create their final colour out of the special composed frits which
contain the colour-giving components. The glazes are made ready-to-use
by the manufacturers which mean that only water needs to be added. They
normally contain Westerwalder clay or ball clay, kaolin and / or
bentonite to prevent the glaze from settling down. As these glazes have
a rather high amount of alkali, it is to be advised to prepare only the
amount of glaze necessary for a job to do or an amount which will be
finished during a working day. In case some settling should appear the
normal setting up agents as calcium chloride or magnesium chloride can
be used to keep the glaze in suspension.

The group of cadmium selenium glazes sometimes shows some defects which
are more or less typical for these glazes. Especially for the melted-in
cadmium selenium glazes counts that they must meet certain requirements
with regard to the composition for a good colour development. These
requirements results e.g. in a substantial amount of alkali components
(mostly sodium) resulting in a rather high thermal coefficient of
expansion (c.o.e.) with a typical figure of (3α) 210 to 240 x
10<sup>-7</sup> for these glazes. The result is that most of the cadmium
selenium glazes show crazing at the normal applied earthenware and
stoneware type of bodies. Only during the 70ties and when the demand for
red-glazed articles was that high, some manufacturers applied a special
body with increased coefficient of expansion resulting in a craze free
red glaze. In many other cases the inside of vases was and is glazed in
such a way that the inside glaze was not crazing and therefore not
leaking when the vase was filled up with water. This procedure is still
applied today e.g. for flower vases where a cadmium selenium red glaze
is applied on the outside and a transparent semi-matt glaze is applied
on the inside. Application of the glazes is done by automatic spraying
machines on the pressed and dried body and the articles are subsequently
once fired at about 1050 °C.

Extensive investigations have been made during the 70ties for the
development of a craze free red glaze starting from the frits. Trials to
lower the thermal c.o.e. of the glaze were focused on (i) lowering the
c.o.e. of the basic selenium-sulphur frit; (ii) lowering the c.o.e. of
the basic cadmium frits and (iii) lowering of the c.o.e. of the low
cadmium containing transparent supporting frit. The average thermal
c.o.e. (3α) for a cadmium selenium red glaze is 220 x 10<sup>-7</sup>.
Target was a c.o.e. of about 180 x 10<sup>-7</sup>.

However, it is possible to obtain similar good results for the red glaze
characteristics by lowering the c.o.e. of one of the composing frits (i,
ii or iii) but as soon as all basic and necessary frits (i, ii and iii)
are modified to lower c.o.e. versions, the characteristics of the red
glaze changes. In most cases it resulted in glazes which were too hard
and/or had a too short a maturing range.<sup>105) </sup>This was the
reason that one stayed with the standard red glazes which had been
accepted by the market knowing that crazing was simply an unavoidable
characteristic property of the glazes. What often was done to decrease
the c.o.e. of the cadmium selenium red glazes was an addition of a
zircon white frit with a c.o.e. of approx. 168 x 10<sup>-7</sup> or a
suitable lead free transparent frit, also with a c.o.e. of approx. 168 –
170 x 10<sup>-7</sup>. Also additions of a frit with an extreme low
c.o.e. were applied.

Such additions to red glazes (up to 15 parts) helped to decrease the
c.o.e. but the glazes were in most cases not craze resistant to a
Harkort test.

Another phenomenon which occurred at the production of e.g. red glazed
vases but also tiles was blistering; quite an amount of open and closed
craters on the glaze surface often together with matt spots or matt
areas. The defect appeared very often at only one side of the fired
articles and a closer inspection often learned that it was always the
place where the gases passed the articles, in any case places with a
less good ventilation. Changing and improving the ventilation in the
kiln (more volumes of air) normally improved and prevented those
defects. Also a more open setting is helpful although there is a loss of
capacity in that case.

A rather open setting and enough ventilation is even more important when
more organic compounds are involved e.g. in a decoration firing. In such
cases all the organics has to be burned off before the glaze matures. In
case of less good ventilation this may cause problems resulting in
pinholes and/or small bubbles. The reason can be that for the printing
media and the cover coat often poly acrylate resins are used. Most of
these components start to decompose at 360 °C at which temperature gases
are formed from these organic materials which must be removed from the
kiln as soon as possible. If not enough air/oxygen is available to
remove these organic gases, the vapour pressure is increasing in the
first part of the kiln which may result in pinholes and small bubbles.
For a complete burning off of one gram of these polymers one needs about
10 liter of air/oxygen.<sup>106)</sup> This makes clear that a good
ventilation and a more open setting is very important in firing cadmium
selenium red glazes.

A typical defect for cadmium yellow and cadmium selenium red and orange
glazes are also the black or brown spots visible in the fired glaze and
destroying the nice warm and uniform colour of the article. The root
cause of this defect is in almost all cases small metal or metal oxide
impurities. A reason can be a contamination of the body by small metal
or metal oxide parts (like pyrite). It is also possible that a piece of
production equipment e.g. for the glaze preparation (stirrer, sieves,
pumps, etc.) shows too much wearing resulting in small metal parts
coming into the glaze slip. A magnet can prevent further damage and
clean up the glaze. In case of copper metal particles this is, however,
not possible. Many of these dark coloured spots have been investigated
by making a cross section of the fired piece and investigating the
particular spot with the help of XR-F. In the majority of these cases
the observations using an optical microscope learned that the
contamination was in most cases originated from the body and that it was
confirmed by XR-F analyses that Fe in most cases was the reason for the
dark coloured spot.

Sometimes transparent colourless rims appeared, especially the rather
sharp rims of cups and saucers. As an explanation for these phenomena is
given that soluble salts are moving to the rims after application of the
glaze and when the glaze is still wet. Drying of the article starts from
the rims so the moisture goes from the mid parts of the article to the
rim taken the soluble salts with it. The moisture disappears at the rim
leaving the salts behind. Those places with higher concentrations of
soluble salts will result in a lower surface tension of the glaze and
therefore a thinner glaze layer after firing. In this thinner glaze
layer the red colour will disintegrate and a colourless layer appears.

Some red and yellow glazes, not all, sometimes showed a white film over
the glaze after firing. This white film is also caused by salts like
sodium sulphate which have moved to the surface area during drying of
the articles while the glaze is still in a wet state. In these cases an
addition of a barium salt to the glaze slip helps to prevent the white
film.

### 

### *10.6. Vein structure*.

### Another aspect of the melted-in cadmium selenium glazes versus the pigmented glazes are the so-called veins in the glaze. The melted-in cadmium selenium glazes always have a more or less cloudy appearance while the pigmented red glazes more look like a lacquer red. These veins are sometimes visible with darker rims. Some glazes have an outspoken vein structure, some less. This has mainly to do how the glaze is built up. The composition of the glaze as well as the firing cycle have an 

influence on the final appearance of the glaze and the vein-structure.
As contrasted with the melted-in glazes, the pigmented type of red
glazes never show this phenomena. If one prepares cross-sections of the
fired glaze and have a closer look with an optical microscope one can
determine that the veins are in fact transparent ‘canyons’ formed
between the ‘clouds’ of the red glaze. The darker parts of the veins are
in most cases caused by a shadowing effect. These darker coloured
striations are generally located on ridges or overhangs of canyons of
clear glass between the ‘clouds’ of the red coloured glaze. It can also
be noticed that in many cases the top layer of the glaze is transparent
as also the intermediate layer between glaze and body. This effect is
more clear and visible if one goes to the high end of the firing range
of a given glaze. Investigations using XR-F analyses have been done on
the transparent, clear glass parts, the canyons so to speak. The
measurements were done for Ba, Cd, Se, Pb and Zn. The first measurements
were done on the glaze surface with only a few microns depth. After
these first measurements the surface of the glaze was progressively
ground off and polished after which the same elements were analysed
again. When

the measured amounts of the elements were plotted against the depth of
the glaze it was clearly shown that the amounts for Ba, Pb, Zn and Cd
were the same for all depths but that the amount of Se was increasing
with every measured depth till the level of 25 to 30 microns. From that
depth the measured amount of Se followed a horizontal line. This meant
that the Se clearly had evaporated from the surface.<sup>107)</sup>

Literature learns that the loss of Cd, S and Se from glasses is
controlled by the chemical potential of oxygen in the glass. Both Zn and
S act as redox buffers that help maintain a stable chemical potential.
If the chemical potential is too low (glass too reduced), excessive
amounts of Cd will be lost, while if too high (glass too oxidized),
selenium will be rapidly volatilized.

Cadmium selenium melted-in red, orange and yellow glazes are always
multi-fritted** **glazes. The selenium containing frit is melted under
moderate reducing conditions to minimize the volatilization of the
selenium and thus fixing the chemical potential** **on a fairly low
level. The cadmium containing frit (or frits), however, are melted under
oxidizing conditions using sodium nitrate as one of the frit raw
materials. These frits may thus be highly oxidized (high oxygen chemical
potential). When the** **glaze is fired its chemical potential will
adjust eventually to the average value of the

various frits of the glaze. The fact that Se has been lost from the
surface layer and that the Cd is stable suggests that the resulting
chemical potential was too high (glaze too oxidizing). The selenium is
most probably lost before the glaze has reached its transformation
point. A way to reduce the effect of vein structure in red glazes is
therefore to reduce the amount of high oxidized melted frits or to
introduce frits which are melted in a more neutral way.

With the above mentioned knowledge it is possible to ‘adjust’ the
composition of red, orange and yellow melted-in cadmium selenium glazes
in such a way that a less pronounced vein structure is the result. The
firing stability at higher firing temperatures and colour strength of
the glazes are however more important for a manufacturer than, in most
cases, a nice ‘cloudy’ effect with some vein structure. If one doesn’t
like this typical structure of melted-in glazes there is now a way to
overcome this with the 3<sup>rd</sup> generation of encapsulated CdSe
pigments which are suitable to fire at high temperatures and give a more
lacquer appearance.

***10.7.** **Pigmented red**.*

It is already mentioned before how the first classical cadmium selenium
red pigments were made by mixing the dry materials selenium metal,
cadmium oxide or carbonate and sulphur and burn it in a (rotating) kiln
at about 600 °C. Different combinations of these raw materials have been
used in the past to achieve the final results. Literature
<sup>108)</sup> is mentioning e.g. the combinations cadmium sulphide or
cadmium carbonate, sulphur and metallic selenium. Also Shaw is
mentioning these raw materials for the preparation of the classical
cadmium selenium pigments. Table XV gives compositions for CdSSe
pigments as mentioned by T.V. Prasad (Cadmium Seminar, New Delhi,
India). Also H. W. Webb gives these compositions.

>  Compositions of CdSSe pigments

BASF found a way to improve the manufacturing through the wet
precipitating process which has been described here earlier already.

Those pigments have been improved all the time by several manufacturers
especially during the middle period of the last century. The majority of
the volume of these cadmium pigments was applied in plastics mainly
(abt. 85 %) and only a minor part was applied in ceramics, see Table X.
The reason for this was that among other things the stability of the
cadmium pigments was much better compared to the available organic
colours of that time <sup>109)</sup>. They could easily withstand the
higher temperatures at which the plastics must be formed, particle size
was good and the necessary percentage for a good strong colour was
rather low. Moreover, the organic colours of that time were fading out
over time. Well known examples of that time were the plastic yellow,
green and red beer and beverage crates of various famous breweries,
household packaging, toys, etc. The overall disadvantage, however, of
the classical CdSSe pigments was the fact that they couldn’t be applied
in ceramics at temperatures higher than 1000 °C till 1020 °C maximum
without losing too much colour strength or turning into dark / black
discolorations. Therefore, the application in ceramics was mainly
limited to decoration colours and porcelain enamels. For both counts a
firing temperature of about 800 °C.

An UK patent was filed in 1979 by Corning Glass Works <sup>110)</sup>
for improvement of the CdSSe pigment, especially when applied as screen
print decoration colour. Following the patent the classical pigment was
mixed with a CdO-PbO-B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-SiO<sub>2</sub> glass
enamel flux, an organic vehicle for printing and also an amount of a
potassium borosilicate glass. The composition was mixed in an ink mill
and screened onto silkscreen paper. This layer was then covered by a
second layer of the same glass enamel flux as used in the first layer.
This principle of applying a second layer as transparent cover flux over
a red coloured first layer is still applied on some occasions and also
recommended when applying red colours as screen printing colour. It
protects the red colour against negative influences from the kiln
atmosphere resulting in a better, bright and high glossy red decoration
colour.

The improvements realised by the systems of melting-in cadmium, selenium
and sulphur into glass (frit) compositions from the sixties and
especially during the seventies of last century, resulted in much more
stable yellow, orange to red glazes with a good resistance to high
firing temperatures as required by the ceramic industry. The melted-in
cadmium selenium glazes could therefore overtook the role of the classic
pigmented yellow and red glazes (not the red decoration colours for
onglaze firing at 800 °C) in the ceramic area during this period as also
is shown in Table XVI.

Higher firing temperatures were possible and this opened the way for
application onto wall tiles, floor tiles, stoneware and earthenware. The
glaze character and appearance of a pigmented red is different as from a
melted-in red glaze. However, by adapting the glaze composition of a red
glaze one could come very close to the appearance of a pigmented glaze
with the advantage of higher firing stability. During this period, the
melted-in red, yellow and orange glazes were much more important than
the pigmented glazes.

A real breakthrough for the pigments for ceramic glaze application was
the

invention of the first generation of inclusion pigments by Dr. Broll et
al. as also described in US patent 3802900 <sup>3)</sup>.

The mechanism for including colour-giving components into a crystal
structure was already known. An example was the SnZr yellow colour which
was encapsulated into the zircon crystal (1932, Stuckert, Degussa), the
ZrV blue (1948, Seabright, Harshaw) and the ZrFe rose (1960, Seabright,
Harshaw). The inclusion of a red pigment based on CdSSe and
ZrSiO<sub>4</sub> was studied for years by H. H. Beyer, A. Broll, H. D.
de Ahna and E. Meyer-Simon in the early 70ties. It resulted in the first
generation of inclusion CdSSe pigments into a zircon crystal <sup>111,
112, 113)</sup>.

As described by the patent the invention was that the CdS.CdSe mixed
crystal stain was formed in a calcinating process and that these mixed
crystals were included in the ZrO<sub>2</sub>.SiO<sub>2</sub> crystals
formed during the same process.

The following compositions are mentioned as examples in the patent:

Short historical review of CdSe pigments vs. CdSe glazes

These mixtures were mixed with water for 15 minutes, poured into
crucibles and fired at resp. 900 °C, 900 °C and 950 °C for 1 hour. After
the firing the calcined products were treated with HNO<sub>3</sub> to
remove the excess of not included cadmium components. In this way resp.
a light red (1), a bright red (2) and a yellow (4) colour was obtained.

In another patent <sup>114)</sup> published in 1976 A. Broll et al.
describe the forming of colour intensive frits to be applied with
transparent basic frits to give stable red and / or yellow glazes. The
basic principle, following the patent, is that ‘colour-intensive’
coloured-frits are made composed out of the colour-giving materials,
zircon, quartz, a mineraliser and a basic frit (example 1). The patent
includes also tin oxide instead of zircon and quartz (example 2) and
other raw materials in the examples 3, 4, 5 and 6. The coloured-frits
are mixed with a normal transparent ceramic frit and the standard
additions for setting-up the glaze. As an example the patent gives for
the coloured-frit (example 1):

>  cadmium oxide 8.6 g

>  selenium 0.8

>  sodium sulphite 7.3

>  sugar 3.3 (reducing agent)

>  zirconium oxide 29.5

>  quartz 14.6

>  lithiumfluoride 2.1 (mineraliser)

>  transparent frit\* 33.6

> 

\* Seger formula: K<sub>2</sub>O 0.25 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.50
SiO<sub>2</sub> 4.00

>  CaO 0.75 B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 1.00

> 

These materials were first dry pre-mixed, than wet mixed, dried and
fired at 1100 °C. 10 Parts of this coloured-frit together with 90 parts
of a transparent basic ceramic frit and 8 parts of kaolin formed a red
coloured stable glaze.

From the end of the 70ties these inclusion pigments found their way into
ceramic application. The fact, however, that the colour saturation was
rather low meant that these stains of the first generation of inclusion
pigments could not be applied e.g. as strong decoration red colour or as
glaze stain in case that a real bright red colour was required with a
wavelength of about 614 nm and high colour saturation. One of the
typical applications was therefore in the sanitary industry. Even with
low additions of this stain they gave good stability to make trend
colours as Bahama beige, Carneol, Caramel, Sunset, Stella, Magnolia and
Anemone.<sup>115)</sup>

V. Lambies Lavilla and J. M. Rincón López <sup>116)</sup> gave an
explanation with regard to the forming of the ZrSiO<sub>4</sub>.Cd.S.Se
inclusion pigments, mentioning the reactions which take place for the
forming of the pigment. They studied mixtures with ZrO<sub>2</sub>,
SiO<sub>2</sub>, CdS, CdCO<sub>3</sub>, S, Se and the mineralisers NaF
and LiF. See Table XVII for the mixtures. The mixtures were fired at 900
°C in an electrical furnace with a heating rate of 300 °C p/h and ½h
soaking at top temperature.

Following the article, the authors concluded after investigations with
XR-D and SEM analyses that the formation of small crystals of
ZrSiO<sub>4</sub> takes place between ZrO<sub>2</sub>, SiO<sub>2</sub>
and the mineralizer according to the reactions as proposed by Eppler.
Simultaneously hexagonal crystals of Cd(S<sub>x</sub>Se<sub>1-x</sub>)
are formed. In the main stage the crystals of
Cd(S<sub>x</sub>Se<sub>1-x</sub>) are trapped by zircon. This phenomenon
can be explained in terms of the theory of sintering in the presence of
a liquid phase

Compositions of CdSe inclusion pigments

An improvement to the system of encapsulated stains was realised by the
BCRA (British Ceramic Research Association, now CERAM) during the 80ties
of last century and published with UK patent 2 106 530 A
<sup>117)</sup>. The basic principle of making the encapsulated stain
was different as from the 1<sup>st</sup> generation. Following the BCRA
patent the processes were following:

preparation of solutions:

(i) 29 grs CdSO<sub>4</sub> + 200 ml H<sub>2</sub>O

to be mixed with

140 grs solution, cont. ± 35% Zr-acetate

(ii) 3.6 grs Se powder + Na<sub>2</sub>S solution (28/1000
H<sub>2</sub>O)

 + NH<sub>4</sub>OH (to make solution alkaline)

(i) + (ii) → precipitate

>  ↓

>  washing

>  ↓

>  filtering

>  ↓

>  drying

mixing the resulting dry powder with 35 ml Na<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>
solution,

dilute to 200 ml with H<sub>2</sub>O + acid to neutralize.

↓

gelling

↓

washing

↓

filtering

↓

drying

mixing the resulting powder with 3 weight percent LiF

>  ↓

>  firing in closed crucibles at 1050°C – 30 minutes

>  ↓

>  grounding in ball mill

>  ↓

>  washing with mixture of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and
> HNO<sub>3</sub>

>  ↓

>  washing with H<sub>2</sub>O

>  ↓

>  washing with NaOH

>  ↓

>  washing with H<sub>2</sub>O

>  ↓

>  drying

The result of the process was that the stain had about 4 - 6 times as
much pigment encapsulated as the 1<sup>st</sup> generation resulting in
the fact that stronger red colours could be obtained for application as
glaze stains as well as (onglaze) decoration colour. See also photo 17
for the encapsulated crystals.

The BCRA produced this second generation of CdSSe inclusion stain only
on limited scale and the license for production was given to Blythe
Colours / Johnson Matthey. The complicated way for production of the
stain has always been a drag for making bigger volumes. Together with
the health and safety measurements to be taken and the resulting
sky-high production costs per kg it meant the end of this development.
Dr. Jörg Keyn, however, mentioned in 2004 that with this second
generation of CdSSe encapsulated pigments the possibility has been
created to make a real red colour <sup>118)</sup>.

After the invention of the inclusion pigments and creating the
1<sup>st</sup> generation of these type of inclusion CdSSe pigments into
a zircon silicate crystal, the developments didn’t stop and based upon
new technologies stronger pigments have been created also by the company
Broll Buntpigmente, e.g. red pigment 3033 and others.

Also in the early 80ties some attempts have been made to apply another
method to protect the CdSSe stains from an early contact with molten
glaze components. This was done with a CVD process (Chemical Vapour
Deposition) in cooperation with the Technical University in Eindhoven
<sup>119)</sup>. In this process a reactor is used where powder material
(like a CdSSe stain) can be brought in a vacuum and at higher
temperatures and pressure. Various gasses can be led into the reactor to
create a coating around the (powder) material. The tests were done to
coat the material among other things with the transparent material
Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>. These first attempts did not give enough
positive results for continuation.

Because of the threat of a complete ban on cadmium during the 80ties one
was looking for different alternatives. The yellow CdS pigment, in the
hexagonal crystal lattice, has many proven properties over (organic
based) yellow colours. Only a low amount of the pigment is necessary to
give a strong yellow colour in plastics (0.4 – 0.6 %). Also the high
temperature resistance during processing of the plastics is a great
advantage. The company Colorsil BV in The Netherlands (a joint-venture
of Reimbold & Strick and Mr. Ch. Zwart) made attempts in the late 80ties
to replace the CdS yellow by zircon silicate ‘doped’ yellow pigments,
viz. zircon-praeseodimium yellow (ZrSiPr) for application in plastics.
One of the problems was that the zircon silicate material made the
plastic more stiff and had also other negative impacts on the
chemical/physical properties. Also the average particle size was too
high and had to go down to a D<sup>50</sup> of 4µm. In cooperation with
the Technical University of Delft they tried to find ways to connect
organic ‘tails’ to the zircon silicate material to make it fit better in
the plastic materials <sup>120)</sup>. This method was successful and
starting from 1994 no cadmium pigments were used anymore e.g. for the
famous beer crates of some of the biggest breweries worldwide. Instead,
one applied specially prepared and coated zircon-praeseodimium yellow
stains for the yellow colour. This continued till about 2001 when other
organic green and yellow phthalo pigments came on the market, replacing
the zircon-praeseodimium stains for economical reasons.

Besides the inclusion pigments as manufactured by the company Broll
Buntpigmente, which soon will likely be the only manufacturer for these
type of pigments left in Europe, another and third generation of very
strong cadmium stains came on the market after 2000. This generation was
developed and made in China and showed a stronger colour compared to the
existing and available stains from West European origin. The internal
Chinese market is demanding huge amounts of products and also red stains
for the ceramic industry which is affecting prices of cadmium and
selenium remarkably ever since about 2002. The Chinese manufacturers
have found a way to produce the encapsulated CdSSe pigments resulting in
much stronger red, orange and yellow pigments than the existing
ones.<sup>121-125)</sup> On top of that the production volumes are that
high that there is also volume available for the export market. An
estimation of the actual Chinese production of cadmium stains now (2010)
is that the production of the cadmium stains is amounting to about 800
MT / month. An estimated production e.g. at Wanxing company is
approximately 60 MT / month; at Jino approximately 80 MT/month and there
are at least more than 10 other factories more producing cadmium
pigments like Baifu, Hangzhou Hongyan Pigment Chemical Ltd Comp.
(hy-pigment) and others. These factories will undoubtedly come to other
than the Chinese markets with attractive prices for their strong cadmium
selenium encapsulated stains. A company as Wangxing e.g. has already
facilities in Turkey, Italy, Spain and Mexico.

With these strong stains one can obtain strong and stable red coloured
glazes also at rather high firing temperatures up to 1200 °C. The vase
as shown on photograph 18 is an example of a cadmium selenium red glaze
made with one of the strong red stains. The glaze is a lead free
transparent one with reference ECR10493-P and the glaze is coloured with
10 % of the strong red stain 14P8003.

> 

These very strong red stains have also been applied to develop strong
inglaze red decoration colours e.g. for firing at a level of 1180 °C
till 1220 °C in about 90 minutes. The strong pigments are used in
combinations with suitable flux systems to develop new ranges of red,
orange and yellow inglaze colours which now show a colourstrength and
colourstability which were not possible some years ago.

It is known that China intends to be in line with international health
and safety regulations, despite the actual state of some cadmium
selenium stain production sites now and in the past. It is already
announced in China that new regulations with regard to health and safety
of different materials, also cadmium, will apply in China as from 2012.
This will probably affect the production of these stains in the near
future.

Now, 2010, the ceramic industry is able to produce very strong red,
orange and yellow CdSSe stains which enable manufacturers to produce
really laquer-like ceramic products, no matter if it is for wall- or
floortiles, vases, giftware or dinnerware and at any temperature which
is required by the kiln conditions. An achievement which could be
dreamed of only some decades back.

About the author

After a chemical education he started working at the chemical laboratory
of Ferro (Holland) B.V. at Rotterdam. In this way he became familiar
with silicate analyses and all common raw materials as used in the
ceramic, glass and porcelain enamel industry. After three years he moved
to the R&D department of the ceramic laboratory. During another 18 years
he was developing a wide range of products for the growing ceramic
industry during the 70ties and the 80ties of last century. Especially,
he redesigned the formulations for the cadmium selenium frits and glazes
to what they are still today. Worked and lived half a year in Italy to
support the ceramic business for Ferro (Holland) B.V. Continued as
product manager.

Left Ferro (Holland) B.V. in 1987 and was asked to join Drakenfeld
Colours to set up a new plant for the European market mainly for the
compounding of the black obscuration glass enamels for the automotive
industry. Stayed also a period at the Drakenfeld USA plant. Finished
studies on Management and courses for ‘Statistical Process Control’,
‘Taguchi Methods’, ‘Fundamentals of Glass Technology’ and ‘Organic
Additives in Ceramic Processing’.

Returned to ceramics in 1993 when Drakenfeld Colours and Degussa set up
the Cerdec joint venture and the unit in The Netherlands was closed.

Joined Johnson Matthey as from 1993 till now with several technical and
commercial responsibilities in the ceramic field viz. technical manager
ceramic laboratory and Commercial & Technical Manager Special Ceramics.
